       "  'text': '\\nA REFORMA DO CALENDÁRIO E AS SUAS CONSEQUÊNCIAS COMERCIAIS\\n\\nA Comissão Especial de Inquérito à Reforma do Calendário, estabelecida pela Sociedade das Nações em 1924, acaba de publicar o seu Relatório.\\nA Comissão era composta do Prof. van Eysinga, da Universidade de Leyden (presidente); Rev. T.E.R. Philips, secretário da Real Sociedade Astronómica de Londres, nomeado pelo Arcebispo de Canterbury, chefe da Igreja Inglesa; Rev. P. Gianfranceschi, presidente da Academia dei Nuovi Lincei, nomeado pela Santa Sé; Prof. Eginitis, director do Observatório de Atenas, representando o Patriarca Ecuménico de Constantinopla; o Sr. Bigourden, antigo presidente da Comissão de Calendário da União Astronómica Internacional; e o Sr. Willis H. Booth, antigo presidente da Câmara Internacional de Comércio.\\nA comissão teve que examinar 185 projectos de Reforma do calendário actual, apresentadas por 33 países diferentes, dos 56 que pertencem à Sociedade das Nações. Responderam ao questionário detalhado, que se expediu aos 56 países e várias entidades religiosas e não religiosas em todo o mundo, 27 governos, 26 organizações internacionais (incluindo os variados comités nacionais da Câmara Internacional de Comércio), 18 administrações de caminhos-de-ferro, repartições de instrução pública de 23 países, e outras organizações que há menos interesse em citar.\\n\\nA origem deste inquérito, cujas consequências práticas e até comerciais convém não deixar de meditar, reside no carácter irregular e defeituoso do Calendário Gregoriano, que presentemente nos mede o tempo. Os defeitos evidentes e capitais do actual calendário são, na opinião da Comissão relatora, a desigualdade dos seus meses, trimestres e semestres, e a sua ausência de “fixidade”. Os meses variam, como toda a gente sabe, quanto ao número de dias de que se compõem, e que vão de 28 a 31, desordenadamente. Os trimestres compõem-se, em sua sequência dentro do ano, de 90 (91 em ano bissexto), 91, 92 e 92 dias. Isto, afirma a Comissão, é causa de confusão e de incerteza nas relações económicas, nas estatísticas, nas contas, nos dados que registam os movimentos de comércio e de tráfico. Também os cálculos de salários, de juros, de prémios de seguro, de pensões, alugueres e rendas, que se estabeleçam numa base mensal, trimestral ou semestral, resultam necessariamente erróneos, por isso que não correspondem propriamente a períodos de um duodécimo, de um quarto ou de metade do ano. Para fazer, com relativo acerto e rapidez, cálculos diários em contas-correntes, têm os bancos que servir-se de tabelas especiais. Além disso, a desigual composição dos meses tem levado as firmas financeiras, na maioria dos países europeus, a calcular as contas-depósito e correntes na base do ano de 12 meses e 30 dias, ou sejam, 360 dias, ao passo que no desconto de letras se conta o ano com o seu número exacto de dias. Todas estas circunstâncias assumem proporções quase trágicas no relatório da Comissão, e a tragédia aumenta quando se chega a considerar a falta de fixidez do calendário actual.\\nDevido à circunstância de que o calendário actual não é “fixo”, mas varia de ano para ano, a sua reprodução exacta dá-se apenas de 28 em 28 anos. Em virtude disto, não podem as datas de acontecimentos periódicos ser, em qualquer caso, claramente determinadas.\\nCada ano, exemplifica a Comissão, têm as instâncias oficiais que fazer um estudo especial para actos como a convocação do Parlamento (inglês), as datas de feriados, as de mercados e de feiras, ou a fixação da hora de “Verão” — tudo, como o leitor está vendo, de transcendente importância para o presente e o futuro da humanidade. Ora, se o calendário fosse “fixado”, as datas destes grandes acontecimentos ficariam também “fixadas”, duma vez para sempre. Finalmente — e é esta talvez a principal desvantagem do ponto de vista estatístico e comercial —, não é possível uma verdadeira comparação estatística entre as próprias subdivisões do ano — meses, trimestres, semestres.\\n\\nNa opinião da Comissão, «a atenção do público, de cuja aprovação tem que depender qualquer reforma do calendário, deve ser chamada exclusivamente (para que possa compreender as suas respectivas vantagens e desvantagens) sobre os princípios fundamentais de três principais sistemas de reforma».\\nO ano compõe-se de 52 semanas — ou sejam 364 dias —, mais 1 ou 2 dias a mais conforme o ano seja normal ou bissexto.\\nPor isso o problema primacial que, no ver da Comissão, confronta o reformador, é o que é que há-de fazer-se deste um dia, ou dois dias, a mais\\nOs “três principais sistemas de reforma”, a que a Comissão alude no excerto acima feito, foram assim resumidos oficiosamente com uma clareza que nos dispensa de tentar outro assunto:\\nPrimeiro sistema: Reforma simples. — O primeiro dos três principais sistemas de reforma escolhidos pela Comissão esforça-se por simplificar a reforma o mais possível e por causar a menor perturbação nos hábitos e costumes correntes, pelo processo de igualização de três dos quatro trimestres de que o ano se compõe.\\n»Assim, cada um dos primeiros trimestres do ano poderia compor-se de 91 dias, ou três meses de 30, 30 e 31 dias. O dia suplementar (o 365.º) seria acrescentado no quarto trimestre, que poderia pois compor-se de três meses de 30, 31, e 31 dias (32 em anos bissextos). Este nivelamento dos trimestres teria reais vantagens do ponto de vista das estatísticas trimestrais, das transacções da Bolsa, das contas bancárias e das médias meteorológicas. Acresce que se simplificariam bastante os cálculos para averiguar o dia da semana em que cai cada data. Assim, se o 1.º de Janeiro for domingo, o 1.º de Fevereiro será terça-feira, o 1.º de Março quinta-feira, e assim sucessivamente. Finalmente, esse sistema é o que menos altera a tradição. A questão, porém, é se as suas vantagens, que são menores que as dos outros dois sistemas, bastam para justificar a mudança.\\n»O segundo e terceiro sistemas principais, não só possuem todas as vantagens do primeiro sistema, quanto à igualização das divisões do ano, mas, além disso, estabelecem um calendário perpétuo e rectificam de todo o calendário presente. Este resultado obtém-se tornando o dia suplementar do ano (o 365.º) um dia em branco — isto é, pondo-o fora da semana, como, por exemplo, entre 31 de Dezembro e 1 de Janeiro. A introdução do dia em branco quebra, porém, a perpetuidade do ciclo das semanas, e levanta certas dificuldades de ordem religiosa, sobretudo nos meios judaicos.\\n»Segundo sistema: Reforma parciaL — Seria o ano dividido em quatro trimestres iguais de 91 dias, compondo-se cada trimestre de três meses de 30, 30 e 31 dias (exactamente como os três primeiros trimestres do primeiro sistema). O dia suplementar do ano (o 365.º) seria contado fora da semana. Poder-se-ia chamar-lhe Dia de Ano Novo, e fazê-lo preceder o dia 1 de Janeiro; e o outro dia no ano bissexto poderia, do mesmo modo, preceder o dia 1 de Julho e chamar-se Dia de Ano Bissexto.\\n»Por este processo são iguais todos os trimestres e semestres. Cada mês contém o mesmo número de dias úteis. Os meses, porém, não são iguais, nem contêm um número completo de semanas. Além disso, as datas não caem no mesmo dia da semana em cada mês, ao passo que a comparação estatística de datas futuras com datas passadas, sendo menos complicada que no sistema dos treze meses, é mais complicada que no primeiro sistema.\\n»Terceiro sistema: Reforma radical. — Os processos que pertencem a este sistema dividem o ano em 13 meses de 28 dias, ou 4 semanas certas, cada um, o que perfaz um total de 52 semanas, ou 364 dias. Sobra um dia (o 365.º), que fica fora da semana.\\n»Como no segundo sistema, este \"dia em branco\" poderia inserir-se entre o 28.º dia do 13.º mês e o 1.º dia do 1.º mês do ano seguinte, ou em qualquer outra altura.\\n»Este calendário seria perpétuo, pois os dias da semana cairiam nas mesmas datas em todos os meses. Quer dizer, se o 1.º de Janeiro for domingo, domingo será também o primeiro dia de todos os treze meses do ano. Todos os meses são iguais, e têm o mesmo número de semanas, de dias úteis e de domingos. Os períodos para os quais se calculam os salários correspondem exactamente aos períodos de despesa. Finalmente, o facto de que todos os meses são iguais tem grandes vantagens do ponto de vista das estatísticas mensais. Há, porém, a considerar que 13 não é divisível por 2, 3, 4 ou 6; que os “trimestres” do ano, ainda que iguais, não contêm o mesmo número de meses; e que a introdução de um ano de treze meses implica uma mudança considerável em costumes que datam de milhares de anos, e, em geral, seria preciso um número muito maior de rectificações estatísticas do que se se mantivesse o sistema dos doze meses.»\\nCabe aqui transcrever os próprios comentários da Comissão. Diz ela que:\\n«... geralmente falando, e considerando apenas o valor intrínseco dos dois últimos sistemas principais, o sistema dos treze meses parece de maior utilidade do ponto de vista da estatística e do comércio, logo que o mês, e não o trimestre, se torne a unidade na vida económica. No caso contrário, seria preferível o sistema dos doze meses. Com respeito à possibilidade da sua aplicação prática, a investigação preliminar mostra que os vários governos se inclinam mais para o sistema dos doze meses, que desarranjaria menos os hábitos estabelecidos. A maioria dos organismos comerciais parece ser da mesma opinião. Há, porém, um número crescente (caminhos-de-ferro ingleses e muitos organismos americanos) que parece favorecer o sistema dos treze meses, e especialmente para ele se inclinam os que usam já esse sistema como calendário auxiliar, e por isso estão habilitados a avaliar dos seus resultados.»\\n\\nNa segunda parte do seu relatório trata a Comissão de uma data fixa para o domingo de Páscoa, que presentemente oscila entre 22 de Março e 25 de Abril — um período que abrange 35 dias. Das respostas recebidas pela Comissão depreende-se que esta irregularidade afecta desfavoravelmente um certo número de indústrias, e notavelmente as do vestuário feminino e masculino, a de sapataria, e a indústria de turismo. Também se queixam algumas instituições pedagógicas que afecta bastante a regularidade do ano escolar.\\nÉ curioso notar que, segundo o relata a Comissão, nenhuma das grandes entidades religiosas mostrou repugnar-lhe, do ponto de vista dogmático, a fixação da data da Páscoa. A maioria das respostas recebidas dão a preferência ao segundo domingo de Abril. Concordando, em princípio, com esta fixação, a Comissão adverte, contudo, que o segundo domingo de Abril poderia cair no dia 8, e nesse caso a Festa da Anunciação (25 de Março) cairia no mesmo dia que o domingo de Pascoela.\\nPara evitar isto, propõe a Comissão que se fixe para domingo de Páscoa o domingo seguinte ao segundo sábado de Abril.\\n\\nNo fecho do seu relatório, dizem os peritos que formam a Comissão que tiveram «impressão nítida de que a opinião pública não estava preparada, mesmo onde acolhesse bem uma reforma, para sugerir uma reforma imediata num sentido determinado... A opinião esclarecida e organizada deveria, em cada país, analisar detidamente os princípios em que o problema assenta, e só assim se poderia escolher, quando chegar a ocasião, o mais conveniente de entre os vários sistemas. Deveria haver, especialmente, um novo exame, da parte das corporações religiosas que entre si se opõem, do princípio do \"dia em branco\"; uma discussão do assunto, em cada país, entre essas corporações e outras entidades interessadas na matéria; um exame por estatísticos e economistas da importância relativa da semana e do trimestre como unidades da vida económica, em oposição ao mês, para se estabelecer uma base para se determinar a escolha entre o ano de doze e o de treze meses; e uma definição das vantagens de uma reforma limitada».\\n«É também essencial», continua a Comissão, «que as investigações neste sentido [...] sejam coordenadas e organizadas em cada país numa base oficial ou semioficial. Uma organização desta espécie tornaria possível o formar-se, nos principais países, aquele corpo de união pública que presentemente ainda não existe, e sem o qual seria prematuro tentar estabelecer qualquer acordo internacional .»\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nThe Infinite is then the Possible.\\nHow does this possible realise itself? How is it realised?\\nIt is realised by numbers. But by how many numbers? By an infinite number of numbers (let the expression pass). The infinite then, in realising itself, realises itself as itself, by itself. In becoming other than itself it does but return to itself. (Cf. Hegel).\\nConsider, the 1 has nor power to produce the 2, neither cardinally nor ordinally; not cardinally because the 1 is less than the 2, nor ordinally because it supposes the 2.\\nThe infinite is Quantity (in-se). Now numbers are quantity but not quantity-in-se.\\nCardinally, the 1 cannot produce the 2, for it is smaller. Note (Let there no mistake. In our mind thinking of the 1 makes us think, by association, on the 2; but this is in our mind, this is mentally altogether).\\nIt is the 2 that might produce the 1 for it is greater and contains it. But it could not produce the 3, nor the 3 the 4 and so on without stopping. We mount higher and higher, in the scale of numbers without ever attaining, so long as we keep to numbers, the limit which we desire. So we are bound to conceive something taken to be as, by paradox, the highest possible number. (Notice the word «possible»). Now this «highest possible number» is manifestly no number, for a number has always a number greater than it is. So we are taken to something which will contain and produce all numbers without being, and by that reason not being a number. (We must have, this is to say, something which is neither a number nor not a number).\\nAgain what is the reason of the word «produce», which we have employed? How can the Infinite (quantity-in-se) produce numbers? Is it a force that it should originate anything ?\\nIt is by colour that we observe colours, that we know colours. We possess the idea of colour. It is in this way that we know colour.\\n',\n",

The sum of things to things, of numbers to numbers cannot give the infinite for to give the infinite among the finite, is to introduce into a numeric sum something which is not a number.\\nIf infinite be a quantity (as some give us to understand when they say the infinite is «that which is greater than a conceivable number», «greater indicates quantity»), if this be so, the infinite when entering into a calculation in other quantities, possess the properties of a quantity, i.e. of dealing with different quantities of giving different results.

Basta-me um carro eléctrico e a espantosa faculdade de abstracção que tenho e cultivo.\\nNum carro eléctrico em marcha eu sei, por uma atitude constante e instantânea de análise, separar a ideia de carro da ideia de velocidade, separá-las de todo, até serem coisas-reais diversas. Depois, posso sentir-me seguindo não dentro do carro mas dentro da mera-velocidade dele. E, cansado, se acaso quero o delírio da velocidade enorme, posso transportar a ideia para o Puro imitar da velocidade e a meu bom prazer aumentá-la ou diminuí-la, alargá-la para além de todas as velocidades possíveis de veículos comboios.\\nCorrer riscos reais, além de me apavorar não é por medo que eu sinta excessivamente — perturba-me a perfeita atenção às minhas sensações, o que me incomoda e me despersonaliza.\\nNunca vou para onde há risco. Tenho medo a tédio dos perigos.\\n\\nUm poente é um fenómeno intelectual.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Theory of Genesis in Series’s philosophy:\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\n\\nTheory of Genesis in S[eries]’s philosophy:\\n\\n\\nThis theory is made clear by an analogy with the numbers in an infinite series, in the simple series of arithmetical progression. Thus, O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,..., ¥ —. By looking upon this we can assert that the series begins at 1, though we are unable to say where it ends. To us, indeed, it does not end anywhere. But what we cannot explain is how to pass from zero to one.\\nConsider the problem of the world in time and see how exact is the analogy. Nay, there is more than an analogy; this of number is the basis of the other.\\nFor, of a truth, time is duration, duration is moments and moments are numbers in time; duration is the union of the ideas of number and of time.\\nIf we wish the solution of the problem of the world in time, we have but to consider number in its ideal extension, as it is here done, and to induce the idea of time.\\nLet us then examine the problem. In the first place it is to be noticed that the passage from zero to 1 is a passing of nothing to something, of a thing to its contrary. (If I may so speak.)\\n(But zero is not the contrary of anything for a contrary is something and zero is nothing. Moreover, when we say a thing has a contrary, if we assert afterwards that zero is that contrary we unsay our former statement or make it absurd, for to say a thing is contrary to nothing, is to say it has no contrary at all. [...]\\nThe 1 cannot produce the 2, neither if it be taken in the sense of quantity nor in the sense of a unit of order. In the first case the one cannot sum itself to itself and produce 2. In the second, the one being only one by reason of there being other numbers obviously cannot have produced them. (Here is the materialistc difficulty. Thales, etc., in Arist. Met. I.)\\nThe series then proceeds from a so-called nothing and yet has not produced itself. The series has been produced. Produced by what? Not by any number of the series, because, as we have already seen, that is impossible. (Not by some numbers of the series, for then it is required to know how the numbers which compose this sum have come to be. And if an attempt be made to answer this by twisting it in any way, the essay fails, for it can either make the sum a number — a case which we have already discussed — or the whole which we shall now consider).\\nNot by the series as a whole, for, as I have said, nothing can produce itself.\\nWe must now make a distinction between the total and the series in itself (the whole). The total is produced by the units, consequently by units in a definite number. The whole, on the contrary, produces the numbers; it is not produced by them. [...]\\nThe series (whole) is Quantity, Number (in its most abstract meaning).\\nA total is any number resulting from a sum, for instance, 1302.\\nA number, a unit is any member of the series.\\nSome may yet think that a whole can be empirically obtained. They say, for instance, «the numbers 1, 2, 3 plus an infinity of numbers give us the total series, the whole».\\nWe must consider this argument. It contains an old term, that of infinity.\\nWhat is this, what does it mean? It means either of 2 things: or the greatest possible number, that which contains all numbers; or that which transcends all number.\\nlf it mean the first (as materialists indeed understand it) it is identical to the series, it means «the whole». So that to prove the whole by it is to beg the question and most miserably to fail. Cur opium dormiri facit? Quia est in eo vis dormitiva.\\nAnalogy and consequence of this in the materialist argument for the empirical origin for the idea of infinite.\\n',\n",

If it be not Being it is not Being.\\n\\nWhat is that which is neither Being nor Not-Being? I believe we shall now find it. Being is immutable, Not-Being is immutable. That which is neither one nor the other must therefore have immutability on its essence. Movement, then, here is the essence of the world. Movement is not Being, but it is by Being. It is by Being: it exists. It is by Being; though a thing is incessantly passing to another thing, still that other thing is itself. A river does not pass to the sea.\\nA river follows itself into the sea. Movement is also by Not-Being it is a perpetual ceasing to exist. But movement in itself is.\\nIt seems, it is true, that there can be in reasoning but Being and Not-Being, that which is not one must be the other.

As tendas que multicoloram as suas ruas destacam-se sobre não sei que fundo que não é o delas como bordados de amarelo ou vermelho sobre cetim azul-claríssimo. Toda a história progressa dessa cidade voa em torno à lâmpada do meu sonho como uma borboleta apenas ouvida na penumbra do quarto. Minha fantasia habitou entre pompas outrora e recebeu das mãos de rainhas jóias veladas de antiguidade. Atapetaram molezas íntimas os areais da minha inexistência e, hálitos de penumbra, as algas boiaram à ostensiva dos meus rios. Fui por isso pórticos em civilizações perdidas, febres de arabescos em frisos inertes, enegrecimentos de eternidade nos coleios das colunas partidas, mastros apenas nos naufrágios remotos, degraus só de tronos abatidos, véus nada velando, e como que velando sombras, fantasmas erguidos do chão como fiamos de turíbulos arremessados. Funesto foi o meu reinado e cheia de guerras nas fronteiras longínquas a minha paz imperial no meu palácio. Próximo sempre o ruído indeciso das festas afastadas; procissões sempre para ir passar por sob as minhas janelas; mas nem peixes de ouro encarnado nas minhas piscinas, nem pomos entre as verduras paradas do meu pomar; nem mesmo, pobres choupanas onde os outros são felizes, o fumo de chaminés de além de árvores adormecem com baladas de simplicidade o mistério congénito da minha consciência de mim.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'A EVOLUÇÃO DO COMÉRCIO\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nA EVOLUÇÃO DO COMÉRCIO\\n\\nEste estudo é propriamente nosso. Não lhe fomos buscar os elementos a nenhum tratado. Não tivemos mestre para escrevê-lo. O conhecimento atento da história, e a análise firme dos factos que ela fornece, foi quanto nos foi preciso para a sua elaboração. Como não plagiámos, nem imitámos, nem se quer aceitámos criticamente, mas pensámos por nossa cabeça, visto que ela existe, achamos conveniente começar este artigo por dizer que ele é nosso, e que em nenhum ensaio ou tratado estranho se encontra o estudo que ele encerra, nem, portanto, os ensinamentos que desse estudo se derivam. O seu a seu dono, mesmo quando sejamos nós o dono...\\n\\nA actividade social chamada comércio, por mal vista que esteja hoje pelos teoristas de sociedades impossíveis, é contudo um dos dois característicos distintivos das sociedades chamadas civilizadas. O outro característico distintivo é o que se denomina cultura. Entre o comércio e a cultura houve sempre uma relação íntima, ainda não bem explicada, mas observada por muitos. É, com efeito, notável que as sociedades que mais proeminentemente se destacaram na criação de valores culturais são as que mais proeminentemente se destacaram no exercício assíduo do comércio. Comercial, eminentemente comercial, foi Atenas. Comercial, eminentemente comercial, foi Florença.\\nA relação entre os dois fenómenos é ao mesmo tempo de paralelismo e de causa-e-efeito. Toda a vida é essencialmente relação, e a vida social, portanto, é essencialmente relação entre mdivíduos, quando simples vida social; e entre povos, quando vida civilizacional. Ora, como os fenómenos da vida superior são de duas ordens — materiais e mentais —, devem ser materiais e mentais os fenómenos da vida superior civilizacional; e, como a vida é essencialmente relação, esses fenómenos devem ser de relação. Como o comércio é, por sua natureza, uma entrepenetração económica das sociedades, é no comércio que as relações materiais entre sociedades atingem o seu máximo; e como a cultura é uma entrepenetração artística e filosófica das sociedades, é na cultura que as relações mentais entre povos conseguem o seu auge. Segue que uma sociedade com um alto grau de desenvolvimento material e mental e, portanto, com um alto desenvolvimento da vida de relação, forçosamente será altamente comercial e altamente cultural, paralelamente.\\nAcresce, ainda, que o comércio é uma distribuição, centrífuga ou centrípeta, da produção material, ou indústria; e a cultura é uma distribuição, centrífuga ou centrípeta, da produção mental, ou arte. Os fenómenos são, pois, rigorosamente paralelos. E, assim como nos países de grande produção artística a curiosidade pela arte alheia se desenvolve, pois que a criação artística própria não pode exercer-se sem interesse pela arte, e portanto também pela arte dos outros, assim também num país de grande produção industrial a necessidade de produtos, alheios — que o próprio país não pode, ou não pode convenientemente, produzir — nasce do estímulo às necessidades internas que essa grande produção criou, depois de ter tido nelas origem.\\nMas entre os dois fenómenos — comércio e cultura — há, também, uma relação de causa-e-efeito. A cultura, ao aperfeiçoar-se, tende para a universalidade, isto é, para não excluir da sua curiosidade elemento algum estranho. Quanto mais fácil for o contacto com elementos estranhos tanto mais essa curiosidade se animará, e a cultura permanecerá viva. Ora como o fenómeno material precede sempre o fenómeno mental, o meio mais seguro de se formarem contactos mentais é terem-se formado contactos materiais; e como a cultura exige necessariamente um contacto demorado e pacífico, o contacto material, que a estimule, terá que ser demorado e pacífico — e é isto mesmo que, em contraposição à guerra, distingue a actividade social chamada comércio.\\nO estabelecimento, um pouco demorado desta analogia ou paridade entre o fenómeno cultural e o comércio não é uma espécie de degressão ou devaneio neste artigo e nesta Revista. Visa, antes de mais nada, a mostrar claramente a importância social do comércio, e a mostrá-la àqueles mesmos que frequentemente a esquecem ou a negam. E como esses, em geral, são os que são ou se julgam pessoas de cultura, o argumento, que se lhes opõe, é tirado das próprias preocupações deles; responde-se-lhes na própria língua que falam ou dizem falar.\\nMas esta demonstração visa, também, a estabelecer — para o que vamos expor do que nos parece terem sido, adentro da civilização europeia, os estádios da evolução do comércio — uma espécie de contraprova constante. Se comércio e cultura são actividades sociais necessariamente análogas e paralelas, deve haver uma analogia e um paralalelismo entre os estádios da evolução comercial e os da evolução cultural. Determinado, pois, um estádio da evolução do comércio, será fácil verificar se está bem determinado, verificando-se se lhe corresponde um estádio paralelo de cultura.\\n\\nTrês são as fases que, a nosso ver, o comércio tem atravessado no decurso da civilização a que pertencemos — isto é, daquela civilização que começa na chamada Idade Média e de aí se estende aos nossos dias. A primeira frase — a do comerciante mercador (assim lhe chamaremos) — vai do início dessa civilização até ao começo da época “moderna”, isto é, o período, do século dezoito para o dezanove, em que se deu o advento da máquina e do individualismo económico. A segunda fase — a que chamaremos do comerciante negociante — vai de aqui até à vinda, não já da máquina, mas da ciência da máquina, ou seja do que denota a formação do tipo industrial moderno — a predominância absoluta (pois até ali era só relativa) da ciência, por meio da engenharia, na vida prática; a mecanização, como dizia Rathenau. A terceira fase — a do comerciante industrial (tal é o nome que lhe da-\\nremos) — é a que parte e nasce deste último fenómeno e está dando a cor ao tempo presente. A razão dos três nomes distintivos, de que acabamos de servir-nos, ver-se-á no decurso desta breve exposição.\\nCumpre, porém, e sempre, advertir que a realidade não é uma régua, nem uma série de caixas: não tem marcas distintas, nem conhece separações absolutas. Quando, portanto, estabelecemos, para a nossa conveniência mental, “fases” e “períodos” na vida e na história, e indicamos certos fenómenos como sinais do princípio e do fim dessas fases, não devemos esquecer que esses fenómenos, que nos servem convenientemente de balizas, não são instantâneos mas prolongados; e que, assim, há um largo espaço em que duas “épocas” sucessivas se confundem e se misturam, a ponto de não podermos bem dizer se tal ano ou caso está em uma ou outra delas, ou se não estará, por assim falar, em as duas ao mesmo tempo. Com esta reserva fundamental têm sempre que entender-se as classificações que se fazem na vida e, sobretudo, na história.\\nAcresce, em matéria histórica, uma outra reserva, não menos importante. “Civilização” é um termo abstracto; a realidade concreta está nas nações, ou nas regiões ou camadas sociais delas, que compõem essa “civilização”. Ora essas várias nações e, dentro elas, essas partes delas, não caminham a par e no mesmo passo. No mesmo século há países que estão vivendo em “séculos” diferentes; no mesmo pais há regiões e camadas sociais que estão vivendo simultaneamente em épocas diversas.\\nQuando estudamos um período histórico, e buscamos determinar os seus característicos, fazemo-lo pelos países e pelas camadas sociais que estão na vanguarda típica do movimento que nos parece ser o da civilização, muito embora esses países e essas camadas sejam na ocasião uma minoria. Nem se deve confundir a vanguarda da “civilização” com a vanguarda da vitalidade social: quando é ascendente a curva da civilização, a vanguarda está no ponto mais alto; quando é descendente, está no ponto mais baixo. Avança-se para a morte como para a vida.\\nCom estas reservas fatais terá o leitor consciente que entender, não só este breve ensaio, mas qualquer estudo histórico em que se fale da “evolução”, de “fases de progresso”, de “períodos de civilização”.\\n\\nNa época em que colocamos o primeiro estádio da evolução do comércio a civilização tinha inicialmente, e substancialmente, o tipo guerreiro e religioso. Sendo assim, o exercício de qualquer mister que não fosse o das armas ou do sacerdócio resultava, para a imaginação de todas as classes, inferior e desprezível. Os misteres que tinham por fim visível o lucro tinha-os essa época por uma espécie de servidão voluntária, e o distinguia com o ferrete com que se marca a sordidez. Na proporção em que ainda sobrevive (pois há fenómenos sociais em que ainda sobrevive), o espírito que animou a formação e a conservação dessa época, nessa mesma proporção se mantém ainda o desprezo pelo comerciante. Atinge de preferência, é certo, o pequeno comerciante de retalho, cuja modéstia social lhe não confere o antigo opróbio. E, até certo ponto, o pequeno retalhista — neste mundo moderno de grandes armazéns e grandes armazenistas — é realmente uma sobrevivência, embora uma sobrevivência necessária. Traz, portanto, ligado a si, com os característicos da época ida em que todos eram mentalmente como ele — por muito que materialmente divergissem —, uma espécie de sombra do desdém que nessa época lhe davam.\\nEsta atitude social, universal na Idade Média para o comércio inteiro, sofreu uma transformação, não decisiva mas episódica, na Renascença; e, como é natural, sobretudo a sofreu nas pequenas repúblicas semiburguesas que distinguiam principalmente a Itália nesse período. Mas, no conceito geral, o comerciante não deixou de ser encarado como, mais tarde — fora já da época da verdadeira servidão —, haveria de ser encarado o operário; como, aliás, muita gente ainda encara o operário nos nossos dias. E, se o comerciante escapava a este opróbio nas cidades-estados da Renascença era, em verdade, não só pelo carácter especial da civilização nessas comunidades, mas principalmente em virtude da riqueza que acumulasse. A época não dava para melhor conceito. Era o homem rico, e não o comerciante, que nessas sociedades desnobilizadas conseguia a consideração social. Subsistia forte o velho instinto aristocrático: tornadas necessariamente, em muitos casos, pequenas plutocracias, as cidades-estado da Renascença honravam essencialmente o comerciante, quando o honravam, não como comerciante mas como plutocrata — como, portanto, em certo modo, aristocrata adentro desse sistema.\\nA contraprova, segundo o critério que estabelecemos, é fácil. A emergência episódica do comerciante na vida social foi acompanhada nesta época, e exactamente nas mesmas comunidades, pela emergência, igualmente episódica, do artista. O facto é conhecidíssimo. O tipo geral de cultura, porém, era de pura erudição; e, sendo assim, a cultura era necessariamente restrita. Era, ainda, servil e empírica, pois a simples erudição é, de sua natureza, parasitária; e o espírito científico, que então renascia, não penetrava, senão incerta e episodicamente, na cultura. Onde havia cultura, porém, e notadas as reservas expostas, ela era intensa, profunda e curiosa.\\nO comércio, nesta época, tinha exactamente o carácter empírico, “especial” e, como comércio consciente, episódico, que a cultura do mesmo tempo revela. A mentalidade do comerciante desse tempo era a do nosso comerciante de retalho, ainda que exercesse o comércio em grande escala. O comércio por grosso, como hoje o entendemos, não era conhecido. Á parte isto, havia um comércio empírico, de aventura. Assim, ao conceito social que se formava do comércio correspondia, em certo modo, a própria primitividade dele, ou, em outras palavras, o conceito que ele formava de si mesmo. Nenhum elemento de expansão consciente, ou de organização esboçada, havia entrado, ou podia entrar, no comércio deste tempo. A inexistência da contabilidade, propriamente dita, define suficientemente o carácter comercial do período. As determinantes sociais do tempo eram outras; o comércio vivia à parte, se não economicamente, pelo menos socialmente.\\nÉ esta a fase a que chamámos “do comerciante mercador”. Em certo sentido, e por uma razão já exposta, poderíamos ter-lhe chamado “do comerciante operário”. Haveria restrições especiais que fazer; mas em sua generalidade representativa, a designação não seria injusta.\\nAssim as coisas se mantiveram, salvas as primícias das forças vindouras, até se darem, ou se acentuarem, os três fenómenos que transformaram, simultânea e relacionadamente, os métodos comerciais e a situação social do comerciante. Esses três fenómenos foram: 1) a transformação social, havia muito preparada, que irrompeu violentamente na Revolução Francesa; 2) o desenvolvimento da vida ultramarina; e 3) o advento da máquina e, correlativamente, o aperfeiçoamento dos transportes.\\nO efeito da primeira destas causas foi psicologicamente curioso. A alteração da situação social do comerciante, proveniente da alteração geral de posições sociais, transformou necessariamente a mentalidade dele. O mesmo homem tem uma alma diferente, sobretudo na acção, quando se sente livre e quando se sente subordinado.\\n\\nAo subordinado são organicamente impossíveis a iniciativa e a organização. Na época em que era socialmente subordinado, não podia o comerciante sequer pensar em dar ao comércio uma expansão coerente, 1.º, porque essa expansão era automaticamente tolhida por forças sociais invencíveis; 2.º, porque, repercutidas essas forças sociais subconscientemente, no espírito do próprio comerciante, a ele nem sequer ocorria a possibilidade dessa expansão coerente. Os espíritos subordinados só se sentem bem na rotina, porque a rotina é a subordinação. Liberto, porém, o comerciante, pela transformação social moderna, dos últimos vínculos da Idade Média, pode por fim dedicar-se ao comércio, não como a um simples modo de ganhar a vida mas como a uma profissão; não como a um mister mas como a uma arte.\\nFoi pois nesta época que se definiram ou se iniciaram os tipos de comércio hoje correntes, e que nós, nascidos já tarde na nova era, mal podemos pensar que não existissem sempre. Aperfeiçoou-se o espírito de distribuição e o próprio espírito de comércio. Desta época datam, organizadamente, o comércio de atacado e o comércio de concentração; nela se desenvolveu a vida comissionária e, mais tarde, se formaram os “grandes armazéns\" de retalho, os consignatários e, por especializações sucessivas, os agentes de toda a ordem que hoje simplificam as operações de importação e exportação, de distribuição e de transporte.\\nParalelamente a isto, os reflexos económicos do individualismo do tempo, estimulando — fomentando mesmo — a concorrência, compeliram o comerciante a sistematizar cada vez mais os seus esforços, a orientar cada vez mais pensadamente a sua actividade, a fazer do seu comércio, não só uma arte, mas uma arte cuidadosamente exercida.\\nNeste mesmo sentido influíram poderosamente as outras duas causas que citámos como determinantes deste período comercial. O desenvolvimento da vida ultramarina, estimulando largamente o comércio a grande distância e em grande escala, veio alargar os horizontes habituais do comércio normal e forçar grande número de comerciantes a, segundo a frase inglesa, “pensar imperialmente”. E o advento da máquina, forçando inevitavelmente a indústria a tomar contacto directo com a ciência, alguma coisa insensivelmente lhe insuflou da sistematização que é a essência desta; e como o comércio está em contacto íntimo com a indústria, para ele foi também passando lentamente esse espírito de sistematização.\\nEm contraposição a isto, mas de acordo com o individualismo da época, o grande impulso que o comércio recebera, a libertação que teve da inferiorização social, as facilidades que estabeleceu a multiplicação de transportes e a sua melhoria — tudo isto fez com que se canalizassem para o comércio inúmeras actividades sem preparação especial ou tradicional para o exercício dele. E isto retardou e complicou a sistematização que se esboçava.\\nÉ esta fase toda que chamámos “do comerciante negociante”. Empregámos esta expressão não como boa, mas à falta de melhor, e sobretudo para não dizer “do comerciante comerciante”, como seria realmente próprio.\\nO que queremos indicar por ela é que neste período o comércio tomou realmente, e até certo ponto, consciência de si mesmo. Organizou-se individualmente, analiticamente. Tornou-se arte, mais ou menos bem aplicada. Distingue este período, significativamente, a organização definida da contabilidade. Uma coisa ainda faltava a este comércio — o elemento final da organização, que é a coordenação, a síntese. Há organização, mas fragmentária; há sistematização, mas ainda instintiva. Por isso nos servimos da palavra “arte” ao caracterizar este período, e erraríamos se usássemos de qualquer termo que se aproximasse de “ciência”.\\nO fenómeno cultural, que acompanha este fenómeno comercial, é de um paralelismo flagrante e exacto. O que distingue, nessa esfera, esta época é a preocupação científica e a da vulgarização ou popularização da cultura. Com a ciência, a cultura toma consciência de si mesma; com o querer por força vulgarizar a ciência, perturba e perverte essa consciência que logrou. A vulgarização científica e cultural do século dezanove foi quase sempre incoerente e incoordenada, a popularização de conhecimentos as mais das vezes imprudente e imperfeita. Há coisas que se perdem quando se vulgarizam; há matérias de todo impossíveis de popularizar. E o crescente desenvolvimento, a crescente especialização da ciência, directa e indirecta, não fez senão multiplicar os conhecimentos invulgarizáveis. O que, em matéria cultural, essencialmente carimba este período é a emergência do jornalismo; e, em verdade, a evolução do jornalismo e a do comércio moderno são de um paralelismo nitidíssimo.\\n\\nComo destas observações claramente se depreende, estamos ainda hoje, em grande parte, e em muitas nações, adentro deste período, ou seja, ainda no século dezanove. Mas as nações da vanguarda comercial e cultural — valha essa vanguarda o que valer — passaram já nitidamente para outro período, e o certo é que em todas as nações se esboçam, com maior ou menor clareza, os característicos dum período novo.\\nTrês são as influências que geraram, e estão gerando, a transformação do segundo período no terceiro: 1) a intensificação de todos os factores que criaram o segundo período, incluindo o próprio individualismo — intensificação porém tão grande que a diferença entre os dois períodos, de quantitativa, passou a ser qualitativa; 2) o aparecimento nítido de concorrências nacionais, organizadas e definidas, umas vezes reforçando, outras sobrepondo-se às concorrências individuais; e 3) o reaparecimento, e desenvolvimento rapidíssimo, do princípio sindical.\\nO efeito principal destas causas — nitidamente sobre o comércio, menos nitidamente, do ponto de vista prático, sobre a cultura — foi, onde quer que tenham aparecido fortemente, coagir o indivíduo, na sua vida material, a um grau de disciplina e de organização que em certas coisas — e o comércio é uma delas —merece já, quase, o nome de científica. A concorrência individual, desenvolvendo-se para além de tudo que o século passado sonhara, obrigou o indivíduo a tomar todas as precauções para poder vencer; e onde essas precauções não são o abandono de todos os escrúpulos — fenómeno aliás hoje correntíssimo em todos os ramos — são o estudo atento dos processos a empregar, o estudo científico onde seja possível, para tomar a dianteira aos concorrentes. O desenvolvimento desmedido da ciência operou evidentemente no mesmo sentido — directamente, penetrando todos do espírito científico, mas do espírito científico de precisão e, sobretudo, especialização, pois as ciências, à medida que se desenvolvem, aproximam-se de um estado matemático e, ao mesmo tempo, se especializam acentuadamente; e, indirectamente, através da indústria, agora inteiramente penetrada da ciência, como se vê na proeminência enorme, e crescente, da engenharia, hoje cheia de ramificações.\\nNeste mesmo sentido operaram os factores a que chamámos as concorrências nacionais e o princípio sindical — este último, porém, um pouco duvidosamente. A “concorrência nacional”organizada foi trazida para a evidência universal pela Alemanha, cujo sistema de estado não só a estimulava, mas como que a compelia, a organizar nacionalmente, como uma guerra — com uma táctica e uma estratégia estudadas —, a expansão do seu comércio. Este factor mais obrigou os comerciantes de toda a parte a dar ao seu comércio uma organização e uma coordenação parecidas com aquelas que são hoje inevitáveis na indústria. E é por isto que damos a este período da evolução do comércio o nome de “do comerciante industrial”.\\nO princípio sindical — propriamente reaccionário ou retrógrado, pois que é uma reversão às corporações medievais — emergiu nas classes operárias, e de aí galgou para todas as outras. Como, seja mau ou bom do ponto de vista social, sempre é um elemento de coordenação, temos nele mais um elemento que se reflectiu no espírito geral e o impeliu mais para se compenetrar da necessidade de organização. Acresce que o espírito de classe ou de profissão, que ele tende a criar, tem também efeitos de rigorosa especialidade, onde esse espírito não seja apenas político; assim, no caso das associações comerciais, gerais e especiais, e das câmaras de comércio, se estabeleceu para o comerciante individual uma maior facilidade de estudar a sua profissão, ou o ramo especial dela que exerce. E o espírito geral de organização com isto necessariamente se ampliou.\\nO certo é que hoje, e mormente nos países mais avançados materialmente, se vai tornando cada vez mais difícil o exercício profícuo e duradouro do comércio a quem não o exerça como se fosse uma indústria, com estudo, “ciência” e sistematização completa. Nesses mesmos países a especialização vai crescendo; é corrente nos Estados Unidos da América as indústrias afastarem de si por completo toda a actividade comercial, delegando em distribuidores domésticos e de exportação a venda dos artigos que fabricam. Em tudo isto se vê o espírito que anima, no comércio, a nossa época. Não sabemos se isto é progresso — porque, em verdade, não se sabe ao certo o que é que constitui o progresso —, mas é fora de dúvida que é muito mais profícuo, muito mais interessante e, até, muito mais simples o comércio quando é exercido desta maneira. A simplificação da contabilidade organizada também define bem, em sua espécie, esta época do comércio.\\nComo estas observações, que acabamos de fazer sobre a fase actual do comércio, são de uma grande evidência, e todos devem compreender que são exactas, não é necessário buscarmos neste caso a contraprova cultural, ou qualquer contraprova mesmo. E é bom que não tenhamos que ir buscar a contraprova cultural, pois — talvez porque a nossa época atravessa uma grande crise de cultura — os fenómenos de coordenação cultural estão muito menos nítidos do que os de coordenação comercial. O que se esboça, porém, nos centros culturais mais representativos vem confirmar nitidamente o que já se passa nos meios comerciais do mesmo nível. Mas, por enquanto, não há nesse campo superior mais que esboços, desejos, tendências. O espírito da ciência e da engenharia ainda não chegou à arte e à literatura.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'A ESSÊNCIA DO COMÉRCIO\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nA ESSÊNCIA DO COMÉRCIO\\n\\nAqui há anos, antes da Grande Guerra, correu os meios ingleses, como exemplo demonstrativo da insinuação comercial alemã, a notícia do caso curioso das “taças para ovos” (eggcups) que se vendiam na Índia.\\nO inglês costuma comer os “ovos”, a que nós chamamos “quentes”, não em copos e partidos, mas em pequenas taças de louça, do feitio de meio ovo, e em que o ovo, portanto, entra até metade; partem a extremidade livre do ovo, e comem-no assim, com, uma colher de chá, depois de lhe ter deitado sal e pimenta. Na Índia, colónia britânica, assim se comiam, e naturalmente ainda se comem, os ovos “quentes\". Como é de supor, eram casas inglesas as que, por tradição aparentemente inquebrável, exportavam para a Índia as taças para este fim.\\nSucedeu, porém, que, alguns anos antes da Guerra, as firmas inglesas exportadoras deste artigo notaram que a procura dele na Índia decrescera quase até zero. Estranharam o facto, buscaram saber a causa, e não tardou que descobrissem que estavam sendo batidas por casas exportadoras alemãs, que vendiam idêntico artigo ao mesmo preço.\\nSe as casas alemãs houvessem entrado no mercado índio com o artigo a preços mais baixos, sem dúvida que os agentes dos exportadores ingleses teriam advertido estes sem demora. Mas, como o preço era igual e a qualidade igual também, não era necessário o aviso; nem houve receio senão quando se verificou que havia razão para mais que receio — isto é, quando se verificou que, nestas condições de duvidosa vantagem para um novo concorrente, o artigo alemão vencera por completo.\\nFeita a averiguação ansiosa da causa deste mistério, não tardou que se descobrisse. Os ovos das galinhas indianas eram — e naturalmente ainda são — ligeiramente maiores que os das galinhas da Europa, ou, pelo menos, das da Grã-Bretanha. Os fabricantes ingleses exportavam as taças de tipo único que produziam para o consumo doméstico. Essas taças, evidentemente, serviam de um modo imperfeito aos ovos das galinhas da Índia. Os Alemães notaram isto, e fizeram taças ligeiramente maiores, próprias para receber esses ovos. Não tinham que alterar qualidade (podiam até baixá-la), nem que diminuir o preço; tinham certa a vitória por o que em linguagem científica se chama a adaptação ao meio. Tinham resolvido, na Índia e para si, o problema de comer o ovo de Colombo.\\n\\nEsta história, em aparência tão simples, encerra um ensinamento que todo o comerciante, que o não seja simplesmente por brincar às vendas, devia tomar a peito, compreender na sua essência. Um comerciante, qualquer que seja, não é mais que um servidor do público, ou de um público; e recebe uma paga, a que chama o seu “lucro”, pela prestação desse serviço. Ora toda a gente que serve deve, parece-nos, buscar agradar a quem serve. Para isso é preciso estudar a quem se serve — mas estudá-lo sem preconceitos nem antecipações; partindo, não do princípio de que os outros pensam como nós, ou devem pensar como nós —porque em geral não pensam como nós —, mas do princípio de que, se queremos servir os outros (para lucrar com isso ou não), nós é que devemos pensar como eles: o que temos que ver é como é que eles efectivamente pensam, e não como é que nos seria agradável ou conveniente que eles pensassem.\\nNada revela mais uma incapacidade fundamental para o exercício do comércio que o hábito de concluir o que os outros querem sem estudar os outros, fechando-nos no gabinete da nossa própria cabeça, e esquecendo que os olhos e os ouvidos — os sentidos, enfim — é que fornecem os elementos que o nosso cérebro há-de elaborar, para com essa elaboração formar a nossa experiência.\\n\\nO estudo do público, isto é dos mercados, é de três ordens — económico, psicológico e propriamente social. Isto é, para entrar num mercado, seja doméstico ou estranho, é preciso: 1) saber as condições de aceitação económica do artigo, e aquelas em que trabalha, e em que oferece, a concorrência; 2) conhecer a índole dos compradores, para, à parte questões de preço, saber qual a melhor forma de apresentar, de distribuir e de reclamar o artigo; 3) averiguar quais as circunstâncias especiais, se as houver, que, de ordem profunda e social ou política, ou superficial e de moda ou de momento, obrigam a determinadas correcções no resultado dos dois estudos anteriores.\\n\\nÉ espantoso — não: é pavoroso — o número de comerciantes que cotam para um mercado, estrangeiro e até nacional, espontaneamente ou solicitados, sem averiguar se não estarão cotando um preço que seja um disparate de tal ordem que os desqualifique intelectualmente — e a desqualificação intelectual é por vezes pior que a moral — no espírito dos que recebem a oferta.\\nQuando um comerciante, que use a cabeça para fins mais interiores que a colocação do chapéu, verifica que lhe é impossível cotar convenientemente para certo mercado, deve responder a um pedido de cotação que, dadas estas ou aquelas circunstâncias, não pode cotar nesse momento; ou que oferece a um preço mais alto que o do mercado (mas mostre que conhece o preço do mercado), porém que o artigo, se é mais caro, é porque é melhor; ou que, por não ter nesse momento disponível senão um tipo desse artigo, não pode cotar senão em determinadas condições.\\nA maioria dos comerciantes — sim, infelizmente, a maioria! —não faz isto, nem nada que disto se aproxime. Cota um preço, porque esse preço lhe dará certo lucro e não olha a mais. Não lhe passa pela cabeça, sequer, que é preciso, às vezes, não cotar com lucro, sendo essa ausência de lucro uma autêntica despesa de publicidade. E porque não lhe passa isto pela cabeça? Porque vive só no presente e tem casa comercial sem amanhã. Porque não pensa que, mesmo quando se não possa cotar convenientemente, se deve atrair convenientemente; e que a demonstração de inteligência e de estudo das conveniências e necessidades alheias é \\\\uma demonstração da posição sobre os ombros de uma cabeça que contém miolos.\\n\\nO estudo psicológico do mercado é também importante, mas, ao passo que o seu estudo económico é essencial e fundamental em qualquer género de comércio, é o comércio de retalho e as formas do outro comércio (de origem directamente industrial) que com ele tem semelhança, que mais têm que atender a este elemento.\\nA maneira de fabricar, de apresentar, de distribuir e de reclamar um artigo varia conforme a índole geral dos indivíduos que compõem o mercado onde se pretende vendê-lo. Num meio de gente educada as condições são diferentes, para todos estes casos, do que num meio de analfabetos. Um meio provinciano — educado ou não — tem uma psicologia distinta da de um meio de cidade.\\nO modo de encarar a vida, ou, pelo menos, certos aspectos da vida, varia de país para país, de região para região. A humanidade, sem dúvida, é a mesma em toda a parte. Sucede, porém, que em toda a parte é diferente. É a mesma nas coisas essenciais, nos sentimentos fundamentais; mas, as mais das vezes, não são as coisas realmente essenciais que ela tem por essenciais, nem os sentimentos fundamentais que a preocupam como fundamentais. Em todos os tempos, em todas as terras, é o local, o superficial, o ocasional, o que mais tem preocupado a humanidade. Ora, é ao que mais preocupa a humanidade e constitui portanto as suas necessidades, que o comércio essencialmente se dirige. E é por isso que o comerciante, que deveras o seja, tem para consigo mesmo o dever de estudar psicologicamente, e um a um, os agrupamentos humanos a que destina os seus artigos.\\n\\nO estudo propriamente social do meio é aparentado com o seu estudo psicológico, mas, ao mesmo tempo, distinto dele.\\nO estudo psicológico tem por objecto a mentalidade típica dos componentes de um determinado meio comerciável; o estudo propriamente social tem por objecto os hábitos puramente exteriores, as convenções, permanentes ou de acaso (e a estas últimas chama-se modas), e os caprichos incaracterísticos desses mesmos indivíduos. É claro que esses hábitos e essas convenções formam parte da índole dessa gente; mas é uma parte “externa”, que não pode ser adivinhada através de um estudo cuidadoso dos indivíduos, mas tem que ser conhecida, mais propriamente, através do estudo do meio em que eles vivem, considerado como destacado deles.\\nSuponhamos que temos que introduzir determinado artigo na Itália. Nem para todos os artigos se dará — mas sem dúvida haverá alguns para cuja colocação importe considerar (à parte as circunstâncias económicas, de que não estamos agora tratando) o italiano como italiano; o italiano como romano, veneziano, genovês, etc.; o italiano como governado pelo regime fascista; o italiano como crescentemente detestador da França; e assim indefinida, mas, ao mesmo tempo, muito definidamente.\\nUm industrial que inventasse e produzisse um tipo de whisky novo, bom e barato, teria um mercado certo nas Ilhas Britânicas; mas, se tivesse a lembrança de ornar as garrafas desse líquido de um rótulo com a bandeira daquele império, não deveria admirar-se de ver a maioria dos habitantes do Estado Livre da Irlanda impor-se o horroroso sacrifício de o não beber. O produto estava psicologicamente certo para esse meio, mas estava “socialmente” errado. Parece-nos que assim transmitimos claramente ao leitor a ideia da distinção entre o critério psicológico e o, por assim dizer, sociológico no estudo comercial dos mercados.\\n\\nEm resumo: o comerciante é um servidor do público, tem que estudar esse público, e as diferenças de público para público se o artigo que vende ou explora não é limitado a um mercado só.O comerciante não pode ter opiniões como comerciante nem deve fazer comercialmente qualquer coisa que leve a crer que as tem. Um comerciante português que faça um rótulo encarnado e verde, ou azul e branco, comete um erro comercial: quem segue a política das cores do rótulo não lhe compra o produto por isso, e quem segue a política oposta deixa muitas vezes de o comprar. Por um lado não ganha, por outro perde.\\nMais incisívamente ainda: o comerciante não tem personalidade, tem comércio; a sua personalidade deve estar subordinada, como comerciante, ao seu comércio; e o seu comércio está fatalmente subordinado ao seu mercado, isto é, ao público que o fará comércio e não brincadeira de crianças com escritório e escrita.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nAS ALGEMAS\\n\\nSuponha o leitor que lhe dizíamos:\\n— Há um país em que, depois das oito horas da noite, é crime previsto e punido o comprar maçãs, bananas, uvas, ananases e tâmaras, sendo porém permitida a compra de damascos, figos, pêssegos e passas. Depois das oito horas não se pode ali, legalmente, comprar arenque, mas podem comprar-se salmão e linguado. Nesse país é crime comprar, depois das oito horas, um pastelão cozinhado, se estiver frio; mas a lei permite a sua venda se, conforme os seus dizeres, “estiver quente ou morno”. A sopa em latas, que vários fabricantes fornecem, não pode ser comprada depois das oito horas, a não ser que o merceeiro a aqueça. Chocolates, doces, sorvetes não podem ser comprados depois das nove e meia da noite, estando porém abertas as lojas que os fornecem. O camarão é, nessa terra, um problema jurídico tremendo, pois existe um camarão em latas que se não sabe se, tecnicamente, é camarão ou conserva; e os jurisconsultos e legisladores desse país já uma vez reuniram em conclave solene para determinar a categoria jurídica do camarão nesse estado. Também neste país se não pode comprar aspirina, ou outro qualquer analgésico, depois das oito horas da noite, a não ser, diz a lei, que o farmacêutico fique convencido que “há motivos razoáveis para supor\" que alguém tenha dores de cabeça. Não se pode, ainda nesse país, comprar, depois das oito horas da noite, um charuto ou um maço de cigarros num bufete de caminho-de-ferro, salvo se se comprar também comida para consumo no comboio. Na agência de publicações, que há ali em qualquer gare, não é legal comprar, depois da mesma hora fatídica, um livro ou uma revista, ainda que a agência esteja, como em geral está, aberta. Nesse pais...\\nNesta altura o leitor, irritado, interrompe...\\n— Não há país nenhum onde isso aconteça!... A não ser que se chame “país” a qualquer reino de revista de ano, ou a qualquer nação sonhada entre os quatro muros de Rilhafoles...\\nEnganar-se-ia o leitor que efectivamente fizesse esse reparo. Existe, em verdade, o país onde se dão aquelas circunstâncias legais. Esse país é a Inglaterra — a livre e prática Inglaterra. E a lei que prescreve aquilo tudo, promulgada durante a Guerra e ainda em vigor, é a Defence of the Realm Act (Lei de Defesa do Reino!), popularmente conhecida, das iniciais do seu nome, pela designação de “Dora”.\\n\\nFixemo-nos um pouco neste exemplo fantástico. Atentemos um pouco neste caso espantoso. O que temos diante de nós é um sinal dos tempos. O ter-se chegado a promulgar, e o continuar-se a manter, num país de que se diz, não sem motivo, que está na vanguarda da civilização, uma lei da natureza delirante daquelas cujas prescrições citámos, revela flagrantemente a que ponto se chegou no emprego legislativo da restrição do comércio e do consumo.\\nA legislação restritiva do comércio e do consumo, a regulamentação pelo Estado da vida puramente individual, era corrente na civilização monárquica da Idade Média, e no que dela permaneceu na subsequente. O século XIX considerou sempre seu título de glória o ter libertado, ou o ir libertando, progressivamente o indivíduo, social e economicamente, das peias do Estado. No fundo, a doutrina do século XIX — representada em seu relevo máximo nas teorias sociais de Spencer — é uma reversão à política da Grécia Antiga, expressa ainda para nós na Política de Aristóteles — que o Estado existe para o indivíduo, e não o indivíduo para o Estado, excepto quando um manifesto interesse colectivo, como na guerra, compele o indivíduo a abdicar da sua liberdade em proveito da defesa da sociedade, cuja existência, aliás, é a garantia do exercício dessa sua mesma liberdade.\\nMas de há um tempo para cá — já desde antes da Guerra, mas sobretudo depois da Guerra, que teve por consequência acentuar certas tendências, e entre elas estas, esboçadas anteriormente — a tendência legislativa começou a ser exactamente contrária à do século anterior na prática e dos séculos anteriores na teoria. Recomeçou-se a restringir, social e economicamente, a liberdade do indivíduo. Começou a tolher-se, social e economicamente, a vida do comerciante.\\nO problema divide-se, evidentemente, em dois problemas — o social e político, e o comercial. O problema propriamente social resume-se nisto: que utilidade, geral ou particular, para a sociedade ou para o indivíduo, tem o emprego da legislação desta ordem? E o problema propriamente político é o da questão das funções legítimas do Estado, e dos seus naturais limites — um dos problemas mais graves, e porventura menos solúveis, da sociologia. Não pertence porém à índole desta Revista o tratar destes problemas, nem, portanto, sequer determinar as causas íntimas do fenómeno legislativo cuja evolução acabámos de sumariamente descrever.\\nÉ o problema comercial que tem que preocupar-nos. E o problema comercial é este: Quais são as consequências comerciais, e económicas, da aplicação da legislação restritiva? E, se as consequências não são comercial e economicamente benéficas, em proveito de quê, ou de quem, é que se julga legítimo, necessário, ou conveniente produzir esse malefício comercial e económico?\\nE dar-se-á efectivamente esse proveito?\\nÉ o que vamos examinar.\\n\\nA legislação restritiva assume cinco aspectos, consoante o elemento social que pretende beneficiar. Há, (l) a legislação restritiva que pretende beneficiar a colectividade, o país: é a que proíbe\\na importação de determinados artigos, em geral os chamados “de luxo”, com o fito de evitar um desequilíbrio cambial. Há, (2) a legislação restritiva que pretende beneficiar o consumidor colectivo: é a que proíbe a exportação de determinados artigos, em geral os chamados “de primeira necessidade”, para que não escasseiem no mercado. Há, (3) a legislação restritiva que pretende beneficiar o consumidor individual: é a que proíbe ou cerceia a venda de determinados artigos — desde a cocaína às bebidas alcoólicas — por o seu uso, ou fácil abuso, ser nocivo ao indivíduo; e aquela legislação corrente que proíbe, por exemplo, o jogo de azar é exactamente da mesma natureza. Há, (4) a legislação restritiva que pretende beneficiar o operário e o empregado: é a que restringe as horas de trabalho, e as de abertura de estabelecimentos, e põe limites e condições ao exercício de determinados comércios e de determinadas indústrias. Há, (5) a legislação restritiva que pretende beneficiar o industrial: é a legislação pautal na sua generalidade proteccionista.\\nFixemos, desde já, o primeiro ponto; tiremos, desde já, a primeira conclusão, que é inevitável. Todos estes tipos de legislação restritiva — beneficiem ou não a quem pretendem beneficiar —prejudicam aquela desgraçada entidade chamada o comerciante. A 1.ª espécie de legislação restritiva limita-lhe as importações; a 2.ª limita-lhe as exportações; a 3.ª limita-lhe as vendas; a 4.ª limita-lhe as condições de produção, se é também industrial, e as horas de venda, se é simples comerciante; a 5.ª restringe-lhe a liberdade de concorrer. Não consideremos agora se seria socialmente legítima ou ilegítima a liberdade que ele teria se essa vária legislação lha não restringisse. Fixemos apenas este ponto: toda esta legislação prejudica o comerciante, toda esta legislação tende a diminuir e afogar o comércio dum país e, na proporção em que o faz, a cercear a expansão da sua vida económica. Este ponto fica assente, fica irrevogavelmente assente. Resta saber se há qualquer proveito social neste desproveito comercial, se qualquer dos elementos sociais, que se procura beneficiar com este prejuízo ao comércio, efectivamente beneficia com esse prejuízo.\\n\\nA restrição das importações, e sobretudo a dos artigos “de luxo”, não ocorreu nunca a qualquer cérebro lúcido como processo directo, ou fundamental, para melhorar o câmbio. Todos sabem que a melhoria cambial tem que partir de origens mais vitais e mais profundas. Essa medida é tão-somente um processo acessório, ou auxiliar, de tentar conseguir esta melhoria. Mas essas importações, que se restringem, de alguma parte hão-de vir. E não é de supor que o país, ou países, de onde elas vêm, aceitem de bom grado essa limitação, por pequena que seja, da sua exportação. Exercerão represálias — as chamadas represálias económicas. Restringirão, por sua vez, a nossa exportação para eles. E assim a limitação da nossa importação redundará numa limitação da nossa exportação. O impedir que saia ouro dará em impedir também que ele entre. Resultado final, pelo melhor: prejuízo para o comerciante importador; nenhuma influência real no câmbio; prejuízo para o comerciante exportador; perturbação da vida económica geral; irritação do consumidor. Resumo: prejuízo e nada.\\n\\nA restrição da exportação, para que o artigo não falte no mercado, exerce-se evidentemente apenas quando se manifeste a tendência de exportar esses artigos, de preferência a vendê-los no país. Ora essa tendência só se manifestará se a exportação for mais remuneradora. E, havendo realmente consumo no país, a exportação será mais remuneradora só quando a moeda dele estiver desvalorizada. Ora num país de moeda desvalorizada um dos primeiros propósitos dos dirigentes deve ser o valorizá-la; provocar e estimular a exportação é um dos processos mais directos para consegui-lo; mas proibir a exportação não é maneira mais recomendável de a estimular. Isto, porém, é o menos. Limitar a exportação é limitar a produção. Obrigando o produtor, ou comerciante seu agente, a vender abaixo do que pode vender, desconsola-se a produção e o comércio. Resulta que o produtor e o comerciante ou procuram a porta falsa do contrabando, com o que se lesa o Estado, e portanto a colectividade; ou baixam instintivamente a produção e a actividade de venda por verem limitados os seus interesses primários. Ninguém exerce de graça uma profissão, por generoso que seja fora do exercício dela. Depois, proibir a exportação é proibir o comércio de exportação.\\nComo, quando se exporta, se exporta para alguma parte, e essa alguma parte, se não pode comprar a nós, comprará a outrem, segue que a limitação da nossa exportação é, muitas vezes, não só a limitação da exportação presente mas também a da exportação futura, pois perdemos mercados que, mais tarde, quando a nossa exportação estiver reliberada, talvez já estejam conquistados por outrem, e se nos não abram de novo com facilidade. Assim a legislação restritiva que visa a abastecer o mercado nacional tende, no fim, para desabastecê-lo e, quando visa a restringir temporariamente a exportação, consegue, muitas vezes, restringi-la definitivamente.\\n\\nChegámos ao ponto cómico desta travessia legislativa. Chegámos ao exame daquela legislação restritiva que visa a beneficiar o indivíduo, impedindo que ele faça mal à sua preciosa saúde moral e física. É este o caso de legislação restritiva que se acha tipicamente exemplificado no diploma que é o exemplo de toda a legislação restritiva, quer quanto à sua natureza quer quanto aos seus efeitos — a famosa Lei Seca dos Estados Unidos da América. Vejamos em que deu a operação dessa lei.\\nNão olhemos ao caso social; tratá-lo não está na índole desta Revista, nem, portanto, na deste artigo. Não consideremos o que há de deprimente e de ignóbil na circunstância de se prescrever a um adulto, a um homem, o que há-de beber e o que não há-de beber; de lhe pôr açaimo, como a um cão, ou um colete de forças, como a um doido. Nem consideremos que, indo por esse caminho, não há lugar certo onde logicamente se deva parar: e se o Estado nos indica o que havemos de beber, por que não decretar o que havemos de comer, de vestir, de fazer? por que não prescrever onde havemos de morar, com quem havemos de casar ou não casar, com quem havemos de dar-nos ou não dar-nos? Todas estas coisas têm importância para a nossa saúde física e moral; e se o Estado se dispõe a ser médico, tutor e ama para uma delas, por que razão se não disporá a sê-lo para todas?\\nNão olhemos, também, a que este interesse paternal é exercido pelo Estado, e que o Estado não é uma entidade abstracta, mas se manifesta através de ministros, burocratas e fiscais — homens, ao que parece, e nossos semelhantes, e incompetentes portanto, do ponto de vista moral, se não de todos os pontos de vista, para exercer sobre nós qualquer vigilância ou tutela em que sintamos uma autoridade plausível. Não olhemos a isto tudo, que indigna e repugna; olhemos só às consequências rigorosamente materiais da Lei Seca. Quais foram elas? Foram três.\\n1) Dada a criação necessária, para o “cumprimento” da Lei, de vastas legiões de fiscais — mal pagos, como quase sempre são os funcionários do Estado, relativamente ao meio em que vivem —, a fácil corruptibilidade desses elementos, neste caso tão solicitados, tornou a Lei nula e inexistente para as pessoas de dinheiro, ou para as dispostas a gastá-lo. Assim esta lei dum país democrático é, na verdade, restritiva apenas para as classes menos abastadas e, particularmente, para os mais poupados e mais sóbrios dentro delas. Não há lei socialmente mais imoral que uma que produz estes resultados. Temos, pois, como primeira consequência da Lei Seca, o acréscimo de corruptibilidade dos funcionários do Estado, e, ao mesmo tempo, o dos privilégios dos ricos sobre os pobres, e dos que gastam facilmente sobre os que poupam.\\n2) Paralelamente a esta larga corrupção dos fiscais do Estado, pagos, quando não para directamente fornecer bebidas alcoólicas pelo menos para as não ver fornecer, estabeleceu-se,\\nadentro do Estado propriamente dito, um segundo Estado, de contrabandistas, uma organização extensíssima, coordenada e disciplinada, com serviços complexos perfeitamente distribuídos, destinada à técnica variada da violação da Lei. Ficou definitivamente criado e organizado o comércio ilegal de bebidas alcoólicas. E dá-se o caso, maravilhoso de ironia, de serem estes elementos contrabandistas que energicamente se opõem à revogação da Lei Seca, pois que é dela que vivem. Afirma-se, mesmo que, dada a poderosa influência, eleitoral e social, do Estado dos Contrabandistas, não poderá ser revogada com facilidade essa lei. Temos, pois, como segunda consequência da Lei Seca, a substituição do comércio normal e honesto por um comércio anormal e desonesto, com a agravante de este, por ter que assumir uma organização poderosa para poder exercer-se, se tornar um segundo Estado, anti-social, dentro do próprio Estado. E, como derivante desta segunda consequência, temos, é claro, o prejuízo do Estado, pois não é de supor que ele cobre impostos aos contrabandistas.\\n3) Quais, foram, porém, as consequências da Lei Seca quanto aos fins que directamente visava? Já vimos que quem tem dinheiro, seja ou não alcoólico, continua a beber o que quiser. É igualmente evidente que quem tem pouco dinheiro, e é alcoólico, bebe da mesma maneira e gasta mais — isto é, prejudica-se fisicamente do mesmo modo, e financeiramente mais. Há ainda os casos, tragicamente numerosos, dos alcoólicos que, não podendo por qualquer razão obter bebidas alcoólicas normais, passaram a ingerir espantosos sucedâneos — loções de cabelo, por exemplo —, com resultados pouco moralizadores para a própria saúde. Surgiram também no mercado americano várias drogas não alcoólicas, mas ainda mais prejudiciais que o álcool; essas livremente vendidas, pois, se é certo que arruinam a saúde, arruinam contudo adentro da lei, e sem álcool. E o facto é que, segundo informação recente de fonte boa e autorizada, se bebe mais nos Estados Unidos depois da Lei Seca do que anteriormente se bebia.\\nConceda-se, porém, aos que votaram e defendem este magno diploma que numa secção do público ele produziu resultados benéficos — aqueles resultados que eles apontam no acréscimo de depósitos nos bancos populares e caixas económicas. Essa secção do público, composta de indivíduos trabalhadores, poupados e pouco alcoólicos, não podendo com efeito, beber qualquer coisa alcoólica sem correr vários riscos e pagar muito dinheiro, passou, visto não ser dada freneticamente ao álcool, a abster-se dele, poupando assim dinheiro. Isto, sim, conseguiram os legisladores americanos — “moralizar” quem não precisava ser moralizado. Temos, pois, como última consequência da Lei Seca, um efeito escusado e inútil sobre uma parte da população, um efeito nulo sobre outra, e um efeito daninho e prejudicial sobre uma terceira.\\n\\nA legislação pautal, que visa a proteger indústrias nacionais, enferma ordinariamente de um mal parecido com o de que sofre a legislação operária, a que acabámos de referir-nos. Raras vezes se estuda devidamente o equilíbrio a estabelecer entre os interesses dessas indústrias e os interesses do consumidor. Por isso o proteccionismo é frequentemente excessivo, e daí resulta, em uns casos, o afastamento do consumidor e um consequente prejuízo para a própria indústria que se pretendeu beneficiar; em outros casos, em que o consumo é “forçado” e a venda portanto certa, o assumir a indústria protegida um carácter parasitário, que a desvitaliza e assim a desprepara para as contingências económicas do futuro. A legislação proteccionista, quando sabiamente orientada, consegue realmente proteger e animar a indústria nacional; mas o ser sabiamente orientada quer dizer que nela se estudaram bem os interesses diversos do consumidor e do comerciante importador. E, se estes interesses se estudaram, e se equilibraram com os do industrial, não se trata já de uma lei restritiva, mas de uma simples medida económica sem carácter especial. As leis proteccionistas só podem dizer-se restritivas quando das pautas resulta um proibicionismo evidente. São as leis desta ordem que caem dentro do nosso estudo, e é a elas que se aplicam as considerações acima feitas.\\n\\nExaminados, assim, todos os géneros de legislação restritiva, chegámos à conclusão que todos eles têm de comum: 1) prejudicar o comerciante; 2) produzir perturbações económicas; 3) nunca beneficiar, e as mais das vezes prejudicar, as próprias classes em cujo proveito essas leis foram feitas. A legislação restritiva, em todos os seus ramos, resulta, portanto, inútil e nociva.\\nNenhuma lei é benéfica se ataca qualquer classe social ou restringe a sua liberdade. As classes sociais não vivem separadas, em compartimentos estanques. Vivem em perpétua interdependência, em constante entrepenetração. O que lesa uma, lesa todas. A lei que ataca uma, é a todas que ataca. Todo este artigo é uma demonstração desse facto.\\nNão é, pois, só o comerciante, mas o público em geral, que tem o dever para consigo mesmo de reagir enérgica e constantemente contra a promulgação das leis restritivas, invariavelmente maléficas, como se demonstrou, por benéficas que pareçam ou as instituem.\\n',\n",

No exercício de um empregam-se qualidades diferentes do que no exercício de outro. Há, é certo, princípios e preceitos comuns a todos os géneros de comércio. Esses, porém, são abstractos e gerais, e aplicam-se também a outras colectividades, não comerciais, que implicam o serviço do público.\\nNos países de grande desenvolvimento comercial, e onde, portanto, cada espécie de comércio se especializou definidamente, há diferenças até de mentalidade entre os comerciantes de uma espécie e os comerciantes de outra espécie. O comércio comissionário implica o uso de faculdades diversas daquelas que entram em campo no comércio de conta própria. A mentalidade do grande exportador (empregando “grande” no sentido de competência, e não propriamente de vulto das transacções) difere da mentalidade do grande importador. A técnica do comércio interno aparta-se por vezes extraordinariamente da do comércio externo.\\nEste princípio deve ter-se presente, não só para fins de organização mas também para fins de se tratar competentemente com os chefes de casas comerciais de países que atingiram uma especialização mercantil definida.\\n',\n",

The only true reality of the compositional type is the one I have called direct; for the legs and top of the table, as also the material from which the table is made, are visible in the same manner as the whole table is visible. Nevertheless there is here a process of analysis; simple but real.\\nMathematic reality is no longer reality at all. The form, weight and size of the table are of this type. These are all given, indeed, by senses; but by a particular use of the senses. (...)\\nIndirect reality is still furthet from the primary sense-impression.\\nA table has weight, has form, has size. These things are properties of the table, but they do not compose the table to the senses. Similarly a table has a final atomic structure, that of the material or materials from which it is made.\\nNow these «realities» that make up the table are of the same kind. The atom — the final element, physical element, whatever it may be — «exists» in exactly the same manner as the weight, or the size, or the shape of the table exists.\\nNeither each, nor all, of these things taken together in any conceivable way constitute the table. It is the table that is constituted, to us, by them.\\nThese things are all DIMENSIONS. Weight, size, atomic constitution, are as much dimensions of the table as its height, width and depth are. These 3 last are decompositions of the geometric constitution of the table. The atoms are similarly decompositions of the (...)\\nThere need be no inquiry into the infinite, or not infinite, divisibility of the physical ultimate. The physical ultimate is no more and no less than the mathematical ultimate, which is the point. To inquire into the infinite, or not infinite, divisibility of the physical ultimate, is to TRANSFER TO THE PHYSICAL, ULTIMATE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH BELONG TO THE MATHEMATICAL ULTIMATE.\\nAtoms, the physical ultimates, do not exist in space; they exist in things which exist in space. Yet these things do not exist in space in virtue of physical, but of mathematical, composition.\\nIt is as if we were to speak of the weight of a straight line, thus transferring one characteristic...\\nNow, whereas a table is a reality, for it is a datum of the senses, the composition of the table is not a reality in the same sense, because it is a datum, not of the senses, but of the analysis, however rudimentary and spontaneous, of sense-impressions.\\nBut an analysis of sense-impression is an analysis, not of reality — for reality, being only reality in so far as it is perceived and only really and fully perceived in so far as it is only perceived and not analysed or reasoned about — but of an impression of reality. Compositional reality cannot therefore be understood unless it is studied in the percipient and not in the perceived.\\nA dimension is therefore only comprehensible in so far as the percipient is studied. Now a dimension being of space («dimension» in the usual geometrical meaning), to understand a dimension we must conceive the percipient as an experiencer of space, or in space; and this means that we must consider him as having a position.\\nThis simplifies matters at once. We have proved (?) that a real body is composed of an infinite number of dimensions. Why then do we speak normally of only three dimensions?\\nWhy is it impossible to us to conceive — except transferentially, non-sensively, by mathematical conception — of four or more dimensions? Because sight, which gives that sense of space on which dimensions are conceived, is static, from one point at a time. If we could travel round a sphere in a right line, tracing a circle round it, or, in other words, following a circle of its geometric composition, and if we could [do] this either in no time, extra-temporally, or receive the sense impression of the whole only at the end and then instantaneously and totally, we would have the notion of a straight line, or of a point, and not of a circumference. There is, then, nothing mysterious in this conflict between the inevitable three dimensions of sense-conception (so to speak) and the possible more of mathematical analysis (?). Position limits our concept of dimensions.\\nIf, again, we could see an object from two sides at the same time (which, be it noted, is not the same thing as being two persons in different points of space, but the same person with the same eyes in two places) an immediate new concept of dimensions would appear to us.\\nIt must be strictly understood that when we say that a solid is composed of an infinite number of dimensions, we mean that infinite number of dimensions to signify geometrical dimensions. We do not mean extra-geometrical properties  — such as weight, size, colour — to be taken as «dimensions».\\nThe dimensions are exclusively spatial, the body has an infinite number of dimensions strictly and exclusively from the spatial standpoint, as a thing existing in space and not «in weight», «in colour», «in size»\\nIt may be said that the notion of inifinite divisibility is numerical and not geometric — that there is no reason to exclude this from the physical ultimate, unless it be excluded, also, from the geometric ultimate.\\nInfinite divisibility, however, means something else. Divisibility of the kind meant implies space.\\nDivisibility in general does not; it implies only number. When we say that six divided by three is two, we do not refer to any spatial operation.\\nThe concept of plurality is all that is needed for this.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nL. do D.\\n\\nReconheço hoje que falhei, só pasmo, às vezes, de não ter previsto que falharia. Que havia em mim que prognosticasse um triunfo? Eu não tinha a força cega dos vencedores ou a visão certa [?] dos loucos...\\nEra lúcido e triste como um dia frio.\\n\\nTenho elementos espirituais de boémio, desses que deixam a vida ir como uma coisa que se escapa das mãos e a tal hora em que o gesto de a obter dorme na mera ideia de fazê-lo. Mas não tive a compensação exterior do espírito boémio — o descuidado fácil das emoções imediatas e abandonadas. Nunca fui mais que um boémio isolado, o que é um absurdo; ou um boémio místico, o que é uma coisa impossível.\\n\\nCertas horas-intervalos que tenho vivido, horas perante a natureza, esculpidas na ternura do isolamento, ficar-me-ão para sempre como medalhas. Nesses momentos esqueci todos os meus propósitos de vida, todas as minhas direcções desejadas. Gozei não ser nada com uma plenitude de bonança espiritual, caindo no regaço azul das minhas aspirações. Não gozei nunca, talvez, uma hora indelével, isenta de um fundo espiritual de falência e de desânimo. Em todas as minhas horas libertas uma dor dormia, floria vagamente, por detrás dos muros da minha consciência, em outros quintais, mas o aroma e a própria cor dessas flores tristes atravessavam intuitivamente os muros, e o lado de lá deles, onde floriam as rosas, nunca deixaram de ser, no mistério confuso do meu ser, um lado de cá — esbatido na minha sonolência de viver.\\n\\nFoi num mar interior que o rio da minha vida findou. À roda do meu solar sonhado todas as árvores estavam no outono. Esta paisagem circular é a coroa-de-espinhos da minha alma. Os momentos mais felizes da minha vida foram sonhos, e sonhos de tristeza, e eu via-me nos lagos deles como um Narciso cego que gozou a frescura próximo da água, sentindo-se debruçado nela, por uma visão anterior e nocturna, segredada às emoções abstractas, vivida nos recantos da imaginação com um cuidado materno em preferir-se.\\n\\nSei que falhei. Gozo a volúpia indeterminada da falência como quem dá um apreço exausto a uma febre que o enclausura.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\nODE MARÍTIMA  Sozinho, no cais deserto, a esta manhã de Verão, Olho pró lado da barra, olho pró Indefinido, Olho e contenta-me ver, Pequeno, negro e claro, um paquete entrando. Vem muito longe, nítido, clássico à sua maneira. Deixa no ar distante atrás de si a orla vã do seu fumo. Vem entrando, e a manhã entra com ele, e no rio, Aqui, acolá, acorda a vida marítima, Erguem-se velas, avançam rebocadores, Surgem barcos pequenos detrás dos navios que estão no porto. Há uma vaga brisa. Mas a minh'alma está com o que vejo menos. Com o paquete que entra, Porque ele está com a Distância, com a Manhã, Com o sentido marítimo desta Hora, Com a doçura dolorosa que sobe em mim como uma náusea, Como um começar a enjoar, mas no espírito.  Olho de longe o paquete, com uma grande independência de alma, E dentro de mim um volante começa a girar, lentamente.  Os paquetes que entram de manhã na barra Trazem aos meus olhos consigo O mistério alegre e triste de quem chega e parte. Trazem memórias de cais afastados e doutros momentos Doutro modo da mesma humanidade noutros pontos. Todo o atracar, todo o largar de navio, É — sinto-o em mim como o meu sangue — Inconscientemente simbólico, terrivelmente Ameaçador de significações metafísicas Que perturbam em mim quem eu fui...  Ah, todo o cais é uma saudade de pedra! E quando o navio larga do cais E se repara de repente que se abriu um espaço Entre o cais e o navio, Vem-me, não sei porquê, uma angústia recente, Uma névoa de sentimentos de tristeza Que brilha ao sol das minhas angústias relvadas Como a primeira janela onde a madrugada bate, E me envolve com uma recordação duma outra pessoa Que fosse misteriosamente minha.  Ah, quem sabe, quem sabe, Se não parti outrora, antes de mim, Dum cais; se não deixei, navio ao sol Oblíquo da madrugada, Uma outra espécie de porto? Quem sabe se não deixei, antes de a hora Do mundo exterior como eu o vejo Raiar-se para mim, Um grande cais cheio de pouca gente, Duma grande cidade meio-desperta, Duma enorme cidade comercial, crescida, apopléctica, Tanto quanto isso pode ser fora do Espaço e do Tempo?  Sim, dum cais, dum cais dalgum modo material, Real, visível como cais, cais realmente, O Cais Absoluto por cujo modelo inconscientemente imitado, Insensivelmente evocado, Nós os homens construímos Os nossos cais nos nossos portos, Os nossos cais de pedra actual sobre água verdadeira, Que depois de construídos se anunciam de repente Coisas-Reais, Espíritos-Coisas, Entidades em Pedra-Almas, A certos momentos nossos de sentimento-raiz Quando no mundo-exterior como que se abre uma porta E, sem que nada se altere, Tudo se revela diverso.  Ah o Grande Cais donde partimos em Navios-Nações! O Grande Cais Anterior, eterno e divino! De que porto? Em que águas? E porque penso eu isto? Grandes Cais como os outros cais, mas o ònico. Cheio como eles de silêncios rumorosos nas antemanhãs, E desabrochando com as manhãs num ruído de guindastes E chegadas de comboios de mercadorias, E sob a nuvem negra e ocasional e leve Do fundo das chaminés das fábricas próximas Que lhe sombreia o chão preto de carvão pequenino que brilha, Como se fosse a sombra duma nuvem que passasse sobre água sombria.  Ah, que essencialidade de mistério e sentido parados Em divino êxtase revelador Ës horas cor de silêncios e angústias Não é ponte entre qualquer cais e O Cais!  Cais negramente reflectido nas águas paradas, Bulício a bordo dos navios, Ó alma errante e instável da gente que anda embarcada, Da gente simbólica que passa e com quem nada dura, Que quando o navio volta ao porto Há sempre qualquer alteração a bordo!  Ó fugas contínuas, idas, ebriedade do Diverso! Alma eterna dos navegadores e das navegações! Cascos reflectidos devagar nas águas, Quando o navio larga do porto! Flutuar como alma da vida, partir como voz, Viver o momento tremulamente sobre águas eternas. Acordar para dias mais directos que os dias da Europa. Ver portos misteriosos sobre a solidão do mar, Virar cabos longínquos para súbitas vastas paisagens Por inumeráveis encostas atónitas...  Ah, as praias longínquas, os cais vistos de longe, E depois as praias próximas, os cais vistos de perto. O mistério de cada ida e de cada chegada, A dolorosa instabilidade e incompreensibilidade Deste impossível universo A cada hora marítima mais na própria pele sentido! O soluço absurdo que as nossas almas derramam Sobre as extensões de mares diferentes com ilhas ao longe, Sobre as ilhas longínquas das costas deixadas passar, Sobre o crescer nítido dos portos, com as suas casas e a sua gente, Para o navio que se aproxima.  Ah, a frescura das manhãs em que se chega, E a palidez das manhãs em que se parte, Quando as nossas entranhas se arrepanham E uma vaga sensação parecida com um medo — O medo ancestral de se afastar e partir, o misterioso receio ancestral à Chegada e ao Novo — Encolhe-nos a pele e agonia-nos, E todo o nosso corpo angustiado sente, Como se fosse a nossa alma, Uma inexplicável vontade de poder sentir isto doutra maneira: Uma saudade a qualquer coisa, Uma perturbação de afeições a que vaga pátria? A que costa? a que navio? a que cais? Que se adoece em nós o pensamento, E só fica um grande vácuo dentro de nós, Uma oca saciedade de minutos marítimos, E uma ansiedade vaga que seria tédio ou dor Se soubesse como sê-lo...  A manhã de Verão está, ainda assim, um pouco fresca. Um leve torpor de noite anda ainda no ar sacudido. Acelera-se ligeiramente o volante dentro de mim. E o paquete vem entrando, porque deve vir entrando sem dúvida, E não porque eu o veja mover-se na sua distância excessiva.  Na minha imaginação ele está já perto e é visível Em toda a extensão das linhas das suas vigias. E treme em mim tudo, toda a carne e toda a pele, Por causa daquela criatura que nunca chega em nenhum barco E eu vim esperar hoje ao cais, por um mandado oblíquo.  Os navios que entram a barra, Os navios que saem dos portos, Os navios que passam ao longe (Suponho-me vendo-os duma praia deserta) — Todos estes navios abstractos quase na sua ida Todos estes navios assim comovem-me como se fossem outra coisa E não apenas navios, navios indo e vindo.  E os navios vistos de perto, mesmo que se não vá embarcar neles, Vistos de baixo, dos botes, muralhas altas de chapas, Vistos dentro, através das câmaras, das salas, das despensas, Olhando de perto os mastros, afilando-se lá pró alto, Roçando pelas cordas, descendo as escadas incómodas, Cheirando a untada mistura metálica e marítima de tudo aquilo — Os navios vistos de perto são outra coisa e a mesma coisa, Dão a mesma saudade e a mesma ânsia doutra maneira.  Toda a vida marítima! tudo na vida marítima! Insinua-se no meu sangue toda essa sedução fina E eu cismo indeterminadamente as viagens. Ah, as linhas das costas distantes, achatadas pelo horizonte! Ah, os cabos, as ilhas, as praias areentas! As solidões marítimas como certos momentos no Pacífico Em que não sei por que sugestão aprendida na escola Se sente pesar sobre os nervos o facto de que aquele é o maior dos oceanos E o mundo e o sabor das coisas tornam-se um deserto dentro de nós! A extensão mais humana, mais salpicada, do Atlântico! O Índico, o mais misterioso dos oceanos todos! O Mediterrâneo, doce, sem mistério nenhum, clássico, um mar para bater De encontro a esplanadas olhadas de jardins próximos por estátuas brancas! Todos os mares, todos os estreitos, todas as baías, todos os golfos, Queria apertá-los ao peito, senti-los bem e morrer!  E vós, ó coisas navais, meus velhos brinquedos de sonho! Componde fora de mim a minha vida interior! Quilhas, mastros e velas, rodas do leme, cordagens, Chaminés de vapores, hélices, gáveas, flâmulas, Galdropes, escotilhas, caldeiras, colectores, válvulas; Caí, por mim dentro em montão, em monte, Como o conteúdo confuso de uma gaveta despejada no chão! Sede vós o tesouro da minha avareza febril, Sede vós os frutos da árvore da minha imaginação, Tema de cantos meus, sangue nas veias da minha inteligência, Vosso seja o laço que me une ao exterior pela estética, Fornecei-me metáforas imagens, literatura, Porque em real verdade, a sério, literalmente, Minhas sensações são um barco de quilha pró ar, Minha imaginação uma âncora meio submersa, Minha ânsia um remo partido, E a tessitura dos meus nervos uma rede a secar na praia!  Soa no acaso do rio um apito, só um. Treme já todo o chão do meu psiquismo. Acelera-se cada vez mais o volante dentro de mim.  Ah, os paquetes, as viagens, o não-se-saber-o-paradeiro De Fulano-de-tal, marítimo, nosso conhecido! Ah, a glória de se saber que um homem que andava connosco Morreu afogado ao pé duma ilha do Pacífico! Nós que andámos com ele vamos falar nisso a todos, Com um orgulho legítimo, com uma confiança invisível Em que tudo isso tenha um sentido mais belo e mais vasto Que apenas o ter-se perdido o barco onde ele ia E ele ter ido ao fundo por lhe ter entrado água prós pulmões!  Ah, os paquetes, os navios-carvoeiros, os navios de vela! Vão rareando — ai de mim! — os navios de vela nos mares! E eu, que amo a civilização moderna, eu que beijo com a alma as máquinas, Eu o engenheiro, eu o civilizado, eu o educado no estrangeiro, Gostaria de ter outra vez ao pé da minha vista só veleiros e barcos de madeira, De não saber doutra vida marítima que a antiga vida dos mares! Porque os mares antigos são a Distância Absoluta, O Puro Longe, liberto do peso do Actual... E ah, como aqui tudo me lembra essa vida melhor, Esses mares, maiores, porque se navegava mais devagar. Esses mares, misteriosos, porque se sabia menos deles.  Todo o vapor ao longe é um barco de vela perto. Todo o navio distante visto agora é um navio no passado visto próximo. Todos os marinheiros invisíveis a bordo dos navios no horizonte São os marinheiros visíveis do tempo dos velhos navios, Da época lenta e veleira das navegações perigosas, Da época de madeira e lona das viagens que duravam meses.  Toma-me pouco a pouco o delírio das coisas marítimas, Penetram-me fisicamente o cais e a sua atmosfera, O marulho do Tejo galga-me por cima dos sentidos, E começo a sonhar, começo a envolver-me do sonho das águas, Começam a pegar bem as correias-de-transmissão na minhÕalma E a aceleração do volante sacode-me nitidamente.  Chamam por mim as águas, Chamam por mim os mares. Chamam por mim, levantando uma voz corpórea, os longes, As épocas marítimas todas sentidas no passado, a chamar.  Tu, marinheiro inglês, Jim Barns meu amigo, foste tu Que me ensinaste esse grito antiquíssimo, inglês, Que tão venenosamente resume Para as almas complexas como a minha O chamamento confuso das águas, A voz inédita e implícita de todas as coisas do mar, Dos naufrágios, das viagens longínquas, das travessias perigosas. Esse teu grito inglês, tornado universal no meu sangue, Sem feitio de grito, sem forma humana nem voz, Esse grito tremendo que parece soar De dentro duma caverna cuja abóbada é o céu E parece narrar todas as sinistras coisas Que podem acontecer no Longe, no Mar, pela Noite... (Fingias sempre que era por uma escuna que chamavas, E dizias assim, pondo uma mão de cada lado da boca, Fazendo porta-voz das grandes mãos curtidas e escuras:  Ahó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó—yyyy... Schooner ahó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó — yyyy...)  Escuto-te de aqui, agora, e desperto a qualquer coisa. Estremece o vento. Sobe a manhã. O calor abre. Sinto corarem-me as faces. Meus olhos conscientes dilatam-se. O êxtase em mim levanta-se, cresce avança, E com um ruído cego de arruaça acentua-se O giro vivo do volante.  Ó clamoroso chamamento A cujo calor, a cuja fúria fervem em mim Numa unidade explosiva todas as minhas ânsias, Meus próprios tédios tornados dinâmicos, todos!... Apelo lançado ao meu sangue Dum amor passado, não sei onde, que volve E ainda tem força para me atrair e puxar, Que ainda tem força para me fazer odiar esta vida Que passo entre a impenetrabilidade física e psíquica Da gente real com que vivo!  Ah seja como for, seja por onde for, partir! Largar por aí fora, pelas ondas, pelo perigo, pelo mar. Ir para Longe, ir para Fora, para a Distância Abstracta, Indefinidamente, pelas noites misteriosas e fundas, Levado, como a poeira, plos ventos, plos vendavais! Ir, ir, ir, ir de vez! Todo o meu sangue raiva por asas! Todo o meu corpo atira-se prà frente! Galgo pla minha imaginação fora em torrentes! Atropelo-me, rujo, precipito-me!... Estoiram em espuma as minhas ânsias E a minha carne é uma onda dando de encontro a rochedos!  Pensando nisto — ó raiva! pensando nisto — ó fúria! Pensando nesta estreiteza da minha vida cheia de ânsias, Subitamente, tremulamente, extraorbitadamente, Com uma oscilação viciosa, vasta, violenta, Do volante vivo da minha imaginação, Rompe, por mim, assobiando, silvando, vertiginando, O cio sombrio e sádico da estrídula vida marítima.

Homens que vistes a Patagónia! Homens que passastes pela Austrália! Que enchestes o vosso olhar de costas que nunca verei! Que fostes a terra em terras onde nunca descerei! Que comprastes artigos toscos em colónias à proa de sertões! E fizestes tudo isso como se não fosse nada! Como se isso fosse natural, Como se a vida fosse isso, Como nem sequer cumprindo um destino! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Homens do mar actual! homens do mar passado! Comissários de bordo! escravos das galés! combatentes de Lepanto! Piratas do tempo de Roma! Navegadores da Grécia! Fenícios!

Homens que saqueastes tranquilas povoações africanas, Que fizestes fugir com o ruído de canhões essas raças, Que matastes, roubastes, torturastes, ganhastes Os prémios de Novidade de quem, de cabeça baixa Arremete contra o mistério de novos mares!

Cuspir dos lábios o sal dos mares que beijaram os vossos, Ter braços na vossa faina, partilhar das vossas tormentas, Chegar como vós, enfim, a extraordinários portos! Fugir convosco à civilização! Perder convosco a noção da moral! Sentir mudar-se no longe a minha humanidade! Beber convosco em mares do sul Novas selvajarias, novas balbúrdias da alma, Novos fogos centrais no meu vulcânico espírito! Ir convosco, despir de mim — ah! põe-te daqui pra fora! — O meu traje de civilizado, a minha brandura de acções, Meu medo inato das cadeias, Minha pacífica vida, A minha vida sentada, estática, regrada e revista!  No mar, no mar, no mar, no mar, Eh! pôr no mar, ao vento, às vagas, A minha vida! Salgar de espuma arremessada pelos ventos Meu paladar das grandes viagens. Fustigar de água chicoteante as carnes da minha aventura, Repassar de frios oceânicos os ossos da minha existência, Flagelar, cortar, engelhar de ventos, de espumas, de sóis, Meu ser ciclónico e atlântico, Meus nervos postos como enxárcias, Lira nas mãos dos ventos!  Sim, sim, sim... Crucificai-me nas navegações E as minhas espáduas gozarão a minha cruz! Atai-me às viagens como a postes E a sensação dos postes entrará pela minha espinha E eu passarei a senti-los num vasto espasmo passivo! Fazei o que quiserdes de mim, logo que seja nos mares, Sobre conveses, ao som de vagas, Que me rasgueis, mateis, firais! O que quero é levar prà Morte Uma alma a transbordar de Mar, Ébria a cair das coisas marítimas, Tanto dos marujos como das âncoras, dos cabos, Tanto das costas longínquas como do ruído dos ventos Tanto do Longe como do Cais, tanto dos naufrágios Como dos tranquilos comércios, Tanto dos mastros como das vagas, Levar prà Morte com dor, voluptuosamente, Um copo cheio de sanguessugas, a sugar, a sugar, De estranhas verdes absurdas sanguessugas marítimas!  Façam enxárcias das minhas veias! Amarras dos meus músculos! Arranquem-me a pele, preguem-a às quilhas. E possa eu sentir a dor dos pregos e nunca deixar de sentir! Façam do meu coração uma flâmula de almirante Na hora de guerra dos velhos navios! Calquem aos pés nos conveses meus olhos arrancados! Quebrem-me os ossos de encontro às amuradas! Fustiguem-me atado aos mastros, fustiguem-me! A todos os ventos de todas as latitudes e longitudes Derramem meu sangue sobre as águas arremessadas Que atravessam o navio, o tombadilho, de lado a lado, Nas vascas bravas das tormentas!  Ter a audácia ao vento dos panos das velas! Ser, como as gáveas altas, o assobio dos ventos! A velha guitarra do Fado dos mares cheios de perigos, Canção para os navegadores ouvirem e não repetirem!  Os marinheiros que se sublevaram Enforcaram o capitão numa verga. Desembarcaram um outro numa ilha deserta.  Marooned!  O sol dos trópicos pôs a febre da pirataria antiga Nas minhas veias intensivas. Os ventos da Patagónia tatuaram a minha imaginação De imagens trágicas e obscenas. Fogo, fogo, fogo, dentro de mim! Sangue! sangue! sangue! sangue! Explode todo o meu cérebro! Parte-se-me o mundo em vermelho! Estoiram-me com o som de amarras as veias! E estala em mim, feroz, voraz, A canção do Grande Pirata, A morte berrada do Grande Pirata a cantar Até meter pavor plas espinhas dos seus homens abaixo. Lá da ré a morrer, e a berrar, a cantar:           Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest.           Yo-ho ho and a bottle of rum!   E depois a gritar, numa voz já irreal, a estoirar no ar:   Darby M'Graw-aw-aw-aw-aw!   Darby M'Graw-aw-aw-aw-aw!   Fetch a-a-aft the ru-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-um, Darby.   Eia, que vida essa! essa era a vida, eia! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Eh-lahô-lahô!-laHO-lahá-á-á-à-à! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh!  Quilhas partidas, navios ao fundo, sangue nos mares! Conveses cheios de sangue, fragmentos de corpos! Dedos decepados sobre amuradas! Cabeças de crianças, aqui, acolá! Gente de olhos fora, a gritar, a uivar! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Embrulho-me em tudo isto como uma capa no frio! Roço-me por tudo isto como uma gata com cio por um muro! Rujo como um leão faminto para tudo isto! Arremeto como um toiro louco sobre tudo isto! Cravo unhas, parto garras; sangro dos dentes sobre isto! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh!  De repente estala-me sobre os ouvidos, Como um clarim a meu lado, O velho grito, mas agora irado, metálico, Chamando a presa que se avista, A escuna que vai ser tomada:  Ahó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó—yyyy... Schooner ahó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó— yyyy...  O mundo inteiro não existe para mim! Ardo vermelho! Rujo na fúria da abordagem! Pirata-mor! César-Pirata! Pilho, mato, esfacelo, rasgo! Só sinto o mar, a presa, o saque! Só sinto em mim bater, baterem-me As veias das minhas fontes! Escorre sangue quente a minha sensação dos meus olhos! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh!  Ah piratas, piratas, piratas! Piratas, amai-me e odiai-me! Misturai-me convosco, piratas!  Vossa fúria, vossa crueldade como falam ao sangue Dum corpo de mulher que foi meu outrora e cujo cio sobrevive!  Eu queria ser um bicho representativo de todos os vossos gestos, Um bicho que cravasse dentes nas amuradas, nas quilhas, Que comesse mastros, bebesse sangue e alcatrão nos conveses, Trincasse velas, remos, cordame e poleame, Serpente do mar feminina e monstruosa cevando-se nos crimes!  E há uma sinfonia de sensações incompatíveis e análogas. Há uma orquestração no meu sangue de balbúrdias de crimes, De estrépitos espasmados de orgias de sangue nos mares, Furibundamente, como um vendaval de calor pelo espírito, Nuvem de poeira quente anuviando a minha lucidez E fazendo-me ver e sonhar isto tudo só com a pele e as veias!  Os piratas, a pirataria, os barcos, a hora, Aquela hora marítima em que as presas são assaltadas, E o terror dos apresados foge prà loucura — essa hora, No seu total de crimes, terror, barcos, gente, mar, céu, nuvens, Brisa, latitude, longitude, vozearia, Queria eu que fosse em seu Todo meu corpo em seu Todo, sofrendo, Que fosse meu corpo e meu sangue, compusesse meu ser em vermelho, Florescesse como uma ferida comichando na carne irreal da minha alma!  Ah, ser tudo nos crimes! ser todos os elementos componentes Dos assaltos aos barcos e das chacinas e das violações! Ser quanto foi no lugar dos saques! Ser quanto viveu ou jazeu no local das tragédias de sangue! Ser o pirata-resumo de toda a pirataria no seu auge, E a vítima-síntese, mas de carne e osso, de todos os piratas do mundo!  Ser o meu corpo passivo a mulher-todas-as-mulheres Que foram violadas, mortas, feridas, rasgadas pelos piratas! Ser no meu ser subjugado a fêmea que tem de ser deles E sentir tudo isso — todas estas coisas duma só vez — pela espinha! Ó meus peludos e rudes heróis da aventura e do crime! Minhas marítimas feras, maridos da minha imaginação! Amantes casuais da obliquidade das minhas sensações! Queria ser Aquela que vos esperasse nos portos, A vós, odiados amados do seu sangue de pirata nos sonhos! Porque ela teria convosco, mas só em espírito, raivado Sobre os cadáveres nus das vítimas que fazeis no mar! Porque ela teria acompanhado vosso crime, e na orgia oceânica Seu espírito de bruxa dançaria invisível em volta dos gestos Dos vossos corpos, dos vossos cutelos, das vossas mãos estranguladoras! E ela em terra, esperando-vos, quando viésseis, se acaso viésseis, Iria beber nos rugidos do vosso amor todo o vasto, Todo o nevoento e sinistro perfume das vossas vitórias, E através dos vossos espasmos silvaria um sabbat de vermelho e amarelo! A carne rasgada, a carne aberta e estripada, o sangue correndo! Agora, no auge conciso de sonhar o que vós fazíeis, Perco-me todo de mim, já não vos pertenço, sou vós, A minha femininidade que vos acompanha é ser as vossas almas! Estar por dentro de toda a vossa ferocidade, quando a praticáveis! Sugar por dentro a vossa consciência das vossas sensações Quando tingíeis de sangue os mares altos, Quando de vez em quando atiráveis aos tubarões Os corpos vivos ainda dos feridos, a carne rosada das crianças E leváveis as mães às amuradas para verem o que lhes acontecia!  Estar convosco na carnagem, na pilhagem! Estar orquestrado convosco na sinfonia dos saques! Ah, não sei quê, não sei quanto queria eu ser de vós! Não era só ser-vos a fêmea, ser-vos as fêmeas, ser-vos as vítimas, Ser-vos as vítimas — homens, mulheres, crianças, navios —, Não era só ser a hora e os barcos e as ondas, Não era só ser vossas almas, vossos corpos, vossa fúria, vossa posse, Não era só ser concretamente vosso acto abstracto de orgia, Não era só isto que eu queria ser — era mais que isto o Deus-isto! Era preciso ser Deus, o Deus dum culto ao contrário, Um Deus monstruoso e satânico, um Deus dum panteísmo de sangue, Para poder encher toda a medida da minha fúria imaginativa, Para poder nunca esgotar os meus desejos de identidade Com o cada, e o tudo, e o mais-que-tudo das vossas vitórias!  Ah, torturai-me para me curardes!  Minha carne — fazei dela o ar que os vossos cutelos atravessam Antes de caírem sobre as cabeças e os ombros! Minhas veias sejam os fatos que as facas trespassam! Minha imaginação o corpo das mulheres que violais! Minha inteligência o convés onde estais de pé matando! Minha vida toda, no seu conjunto nervoso, histérico, absurdo, O grande organismo de que cada acto de pirataria que se cometeu Fosse uma célula consciente — e todo eu turbilhonasse Como uma imensa podridão ondeando, e fosse aquilo tudo!  Com tal velocidade desmedida, pavorosa, A máquina de febre das minhas visões transbordantes Gira agora que a minha consciência, volante, É apenas um nevoento círculo assobiando no ar.           Fifteen men on fhe Dead Man's Chest           Yo-ho ho and a bottle of rum!   Eh-lahô-lahô-laHO — láhá-á-ááá — ààà...  Ah! a selvajaria desta selvajaria! Merda Pra toda a vida como a nossa, que não é nada disto! Eu prà'qui engenheiro, prático à força, sensível a tudo Prà'qui parado, em relação a vós, mesmo quando ando; Mesmo quando ajo, inerte; mesmo quando me imponho, débil; Estático, quebrado, dissidente cobarde da vossa Glória, Da vossa grande dinâmica estridente, quente e sangrenta!  Arre! por não poder agir de acordo com o meu delírio! Arre! por andar sempre agarrado às saias da civilização! Por andar com a douceur des moeurs às costas, como um fardo de rendas! Moços de esquina — todos nós o somos — do humanitarismo moderno! Estupores de tísicos, de neurasténicos, de linfáticos, Sem coragem para ser gente com violência e audácia, Com a alma como uma galinha presa por uma perna!  Ah, os piratas! os piratas! A ânsia do ilegal unido ao feroz, A ânsia das coisas absolutamente cruéis e abomináveis, Que rói como um cio abstracto os nossos corpos franzinos, Os nossos nervos femininos e delicados, E põe grandes febres loucas nos nossos olhares vazios!  Obrigai-me a ajoelhar diante de vós! Humilhai-me e batei-me! Fazei de mim o vosso escravo e a vossa coisa! E que o vosso desprezo por mim nunca me abandone, Ó meus senhores! ó meus senhores!  Tomar sempre gloriosamente a parte submissa Nos acontecimentos de sangue e nas sensualidades estiradas! Desabai sobre mim, como grandes muros pesados, Ó bárbaros do antigo mar! Rasgai-me e feri-me! De leste a oeste do meu corpo Riscai de sangue a minha carne! Beijai com cutelos de bordo e açoites e raiva O meu alegre terror carnal de vos pertencer. A minha ânsia masoquista em me dar à vossa fúria, Em ser objecto inerte e sentiente da vossa omnívora crueldade, Dominadores, senhores, imperadores, corcéis! Ah, torturai-me, Rasgai-me e abri-me! Desfeito em pedaços conscientes Entornai-me sobre os conveses, Espalhai-me nos mares, deixai-me Nas praias ávidas das ilhas!  Cevai sobre mim todo o meu misticismo de vós! Cinzelai a sangue a minh'alma Cortai, riscai! Ó tatuadores da minha imaginação corpórea! Esfoladores amados da minha carnal submissão! Submetei-me como quem mata um cão a pontapés! Fazei de mim o poço para o vosso desprezo de domínio!  Fazei de mim as vossas vítimas todas! Como Cristo sofreu por todos os homens, quero sofrer Por todas as vossas vítimas às vossas mãos, Ës vossas mãos calosas, sangrentas e de dedos decepados Nos assaltos bruscos de amuradas!  Fazei de mim qualquer coisa como se eu fosse Arrastado — ó prazer, ó beijada dor! — Arrastado à cauda de cavalos chicoteados por vós... Mas isto no mar, isto no ma-a-a-ar, isto no MA-A-A-AR! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH! No MA-A-AA-AR!  Yeh eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Yeh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Yeh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Grita tudo! tudo a gritar! ventos, vagas, barcos, Marés, gáveas, piratas, a minha alma, o sangue, e o ar, e o ar! Eh-eh-eh-eh! Yeh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Yeh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Tudo canta a gritar!                  FIFTEEN MEN ON THE DEAD MAN'S CHEST.                      YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh! Eh-lahô-lahô-laHO-O-O-ôô-lahá-á á — ààà!  AHÓ-Ó-Ó Ó Ó Ó-Ó Ó Ó Ó Ó — yyy!... SCHOONER AHÓ-Ó-Ó-Ó-Ó-Ó-Ó-Ó-Ó-Ó — yyyy!...  Darby M'Graw-aw-aw-aw-aw-aw! DARBY M'GRAW-AW-AW-AW-AW-AW-AW! FETCH A-A-AFT THE RU-U-U-U-U-UM, DARBY!  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh eh-eh-eh! EH-EH EH-EH-EH EH-EH EH-EH EH-EH-EH! EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH EH EH-EH! EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH!  EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH-EH!  Parte-se em mim qualquer coisa. O vermelho anoiteceu. Senti demais para poder continuar a sentir. Esgotou-se-me a alma, ficou só um eco dentro de mim. Decresce sensivelmente a velocidade do volante. Tiram-me um pouco as mãos dos olhos os meus sonhos. Dentro de mim há um só vácuo, um deserto, um mar nocturno. E logo que sinto que, há um mar nocturno dentro de mim, Sabe dos longes dele, nasce do seu silêncio, Outra vez, outra vez o vasto grito antiquíssimo. De repente, como um relâmpago de som, que não faz barulho mas ternura, Subitamente abrangendo todo o horizonte marítimo Húmido e sombrio marulho humano nocturno, Voz de sereia longínqua chorando, chamando, Vem do fundo do Longe, do fundo do Mar, da alma dos Abismos, E à tona dele, como algas, bóiam meus sonhos desfeitos...  Ahó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó — yy... Schooner ahó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó-ó — yy......  Ah, o orvalho sobre a minha excitação! o frescor nocturno no meu oceano interior! Eis tudo em mim de repente ante uma noite no mar Cheia de enorme mistério humaníssimo das ondas nocturnas. A lua sobe no horizonte E a minha infância feliz acorda, como uma lágrima, em mim. O meu passado ressurge, como se esse grito marítimo Fosse um aroma, uma voz, o eco duma canção Que fosse chamar ao meu passado Por aquela felicidade que nunca mais tornarei a ter.  Era na velha casa sossegada ao pé do rio... (As janelas do meu quarto, e as da casa-de-jantar também, Davam, por sobre umas casas baixas, para o rio próximo, Para o Tejo, este mesmo Tejo, mas noutro ponto, mais abaixo... Se eu agora chegasse às mesmas janelas não chegava às mesmas janelas. Aquele tempo passou como o fumo dum vapor no mar alto...)  Uma inexplicável ternura, Um remorso comovido e lacrimoso, Por todas aquelas vítimas — principalmente as crianças — Que sonhei fazendo ao sonhar-me pirata antigo, Emoção comovida, porque elas foram minhas vítimas; Terna e suave, porque não o foram realmente; Uma ternura confusa, como um vidro embaciado, azulada, Canta velhas canções na minha pobre alma dolorida.  Ah, como pude eu pensar, sonhar aquelas coisas? Que longe estou do que fui há uns momentos! Histeria das sensações — ora estas, ora as opostas! Na loura manhã que se ergue, como o meu ouvido só escolhe As coisas de acordo com esta emoção — o marulho das águas, O marulho leve das águas do rio de encontro aos cais..., A vela passando perto do outro lado do rio, Os montes longínquos, dum azul japonês, As casas de Almada, E o que há de suavidade e de infância na hora matutina!...  Uma gaivota que passa, E a minha ternura é maior.  Mas todo este tempo não estive a reparar para nada. Tudo isto foi uma impressão só da pele, como uma carícia Todo este tempo não tirei os olhos do meu sonho longínquo, Da minha casa ao pé do rio, Da minha infância ao pé do rio, Das janelas do meu quarto dando para o rio de noite, E a paz do luar esparso nas águas!... Minha velha tia, que me amava por causa do filho que perdeu..., Minha velha tia costumava adormecer-me cantando-me (Se bem que eu fosse já crescido demais para isso)... Lembro-me e as lágrimas caem sobre o meu coração e lavam-no da vida, E ergue-se uma leve brisa marítima dentro de mim. Às vezes ela cantava a «Nau Catrineta»:           Lá vai a Nau Catrineta          Por sobre as águas do mar...  E outras vezes, numa melodia muito saudosa e tão medieval, Era a «Bela Infanta»... Relembro, e a pobre velha voz ergue-se dentro de mim E lembra-me que pouco me lembrei dela depois, e ela amava-me tanto! Como fui ingrato para ela — e afinal que fiz eu da vida? Era a «Bela Infanta»... Eu fechava os olhos e ela cantava:           Estando a Bela Infanta           No seu jardim assentada   Eu abria um pouco os olhos e via a janela cheia de luar E depois fechava os olhos outra vez, e em tudo isto era feliz.           Estando a Bela Infanta           No seu jardim assentada,           Seu pente de ouro na mão,           Seus cabelos penteava   Ó meu passado de infância, boneco que me partiram!  Não poder viajar pra o passado, para aquela casa e aquela afeição, E ficar lá sempre, sempre criança e sempre contente!  Mas tudo isto foi o Passado, lanterna a uma esquina de rua velha. Pensar isto faz frio, faz fome duma coisa que se não pode obter. Dá-me não sei que remorso absurdo pensar nisto. Oh turbilhão lento de sensações desencontradas! Vertigem ténue de confusas coisas na alma! Fúrias partidas, ternuras como carrinhos de linha com que as crianças brincam, Grandes desabamentos de imaginação sobre os olhos dos sentidos, Lágrimas, lágrimas inúteis, Leves brisas de contradição roçando pela face a alma...  Evoco, por um esforço voluntário, para sair desta emoção, Evoco, com um esforço desesperado, seco, nulo, A canção do Grande Pirata, quando estava a morrer:           Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest.           Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!   Mas a canção é uma linha recta mal traçada dentro de mim...  Esforço-me e consigo chamar outra vez ante os meus olhos na alma, Outra vez, mas através duma imaginação quase literária, A fúria da pirataria, da chacina, o apetite, quase o paladar, do saque, Da chacina inútil de mulheres e de crianças, Da tortura fútil, e só para nos distrairmos, dos passageiros pobres E a sensualidade de escangalhar e partir as coisas mais queridas dos outros, Mas sonho isto tudo com um medo de qualquer coisa respirar-me sobre a nuca. Lembro-me de que seria interessante Enforcar os filhos à vista das mães (Mas sinto-me sem querer as mães deles), Enterrar vivas nas ilhas desertas as crianças de quatro anos Levando os pais em barcos até lá para verem (Mas estremeço, lembrando-me dum filho que não tenho e está dormindo tranquilo em casa).  Aguilhoo uma ânsia fria dos crimes marítimos, Duma inquisição sem a desculpa da Fé, Crimes nem sequer com razão de ser de maldade e de fúria, Feitos a frio, nem sequer para ferir, nem sequer para fazer mal, Nem sequer para nos divertirmos, mas apenas para passar o tempo, Como quem faz paciências a uma mesa de jantar de província com a toalha atirada pra o outro lado da mesa depois de jantar, Só pelo suave gosto de cometer crimes abomináveis e não os achar grande coisa, De ver sofrer até ao ponto da loucura e da morte-pela-dor mas nunca deixar chegar lá... Mas a minha imaginação recusa-se a acompanhar-me. Um calafrio arrepia-me. E de repente, mais de repente do que da outra vez, de mais longe, de mais fundo, De repente — oh pavor por todas as minhas veias! —, Oh frio repentino da porta para o Mistério que se abriu dentro de mim e deixou entrar uma corrente de ar! Lembro-me de Deus, do Transcendental da vida, e de repente A velha voz do marinheiro inglês Jim Barns com quem eu falava, Tornada voz das ternuras misteriosas dentro de mim, das pequenas coisas de regaço de mãe e de fita de cabelo de irmã, Mas estupendamente vinda de além da aparência das coisas, A Voz surda e remota tornada A Voz Absoluta, a Voz Sem Boca, Vinda de sobre e de dentro da solidão nocturna dos mares, Chama por mim, chama por mim, chama por mim...  Vem surdamente, como se fosse suprimida e se ouvisse, Longinquamente, como se estivesse soando noutro lugar e aqui não se pudesse ouvir, Como um soluço abafado, uma luz que se apaga, um hálito silencioso, De nenhum lado do espaço, de nenhum local no tempo, O grito eterno e nocturno, o sopro fundo e confuso:  Ahô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô — yyy ...... Ahô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô — — yyy...... Schooner ah-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô-ô — — yy.........  Tremo com frio da alma repassando-me o corpo E abro de repente os olhos, que não tinha fechado. Ah, que alegria a de sair dos sonhos de vez! Eis outra vez o mundo real, tão bondoso para os nervos! Ei-lo a esta hora matutina em que entram os paquetes que chegam cedo.  Já não me importa o paquete que entrava. Ainda está longe. Só o que está perto agora me lava a alma. A minha imaginação higiénica, forte, prática, Preocupa-se agora apenas com as coisas modernas e úteis, Com os navios de carga, com os paquetes e os passageiros, Com as fortes coisas imediatas, modernas, comerciais, verdadeiras. Abranda o seu giro dentro de mim o volante.  Maravilhosa vida marítima moderna, Toda limpeza, máquinas e saúde! Tudo tão bem arranjado, tão espontaneamente ajustado, Todas as peças das máquinas, todos os navios pelos mares, Todos os elementos da actividade comercial de exportação e importação Tão maravilhosamente combinando-se Que corre tudo como se fosse por leis naturais, Nenhuma coisa esbarrando com outra!  Nada perdeu a poesia. E agora há a mais as máquinas Com a sua poesia também, e todo o novo género de vida Comercial, mundana, intelectual, sentimental, Que a era das máquinas veio trazer para as almas. As viagens agora são tão belas como eram dantes E um navio será sempre belo, só porque é um navio. Viajar ainda é viajar e o longe está sempre onde esteve — Em parte nenhuma, graças a Deus!  Os portos cheios de vapores de muitas espécies! Pequenos, grandes, de várias cores, com várias disposições de vigias, De tão deliciosamente tantas companhias de navegação! Vapores nos portos, tão individuais na separação destacada dos ancoramentos! Tão prazenteiro o seu garbo quieto de coisas comerciais que andam no mar, No velho mar sempre o homérico, ó Ulisses! O olhar humanitário dos faróis na distância da noite, Ou o súbito farol próximo na noite muito escura («Que perto da terra que estávamos passando!» E o som da água canta-nos ao ouvido)!...  Tudo isto hoje é como sempre foi, mas há o comércio; E o destino comercial dos grandes vapores Envaidece-me da minha época! A mistura de gente a bordo dos navios de passageiros Dá-me o orgulho moderno de viver numa época onde é tão fácil Misturarem-se as raças, transporem-se os espaços, ver com facilidade todas as coisas, E gozar a vida realizando um grande número de sonhos.  Limpos, regulares, modernos como um escritório com guichets em redes de arame amarelo, Meus sentimentos agora, naturais e comedidos como gentlemen, São práticos, longe de desvairamentos, enchem de ar marítimo os pulmões, Como gente perfeitamente consciente de como é higiénico respirar o ar do mar.  O dia é perfeitamente já de horas de trabalho. Começa tudo a movimentar-se, a regularizar-se. Com um grande prazer natural e directo percorro com a alma Todas as operações comerciais necessárias a um embarque de mercadorias A minha época é o carimbo que levam todas as facturas, E sinto que todas as cartas de todos os escritórios Deviam ser endereçadas a mim.  Um conhecimento de bordo tem tanta individualidade, E uma assinatura de comandante de navio é tão bela e moderna! Rigor comercial do princípio e do fim das cartas: Dear Sirs — Messieurs — Amigos e Srs., Yours faithfully —... nos salutations empressées... Tudo isto não é só humano e limpo, mas também belo, E tem ao fim um destino marítimo, um vapor onde embarquem As mercadorias de que as cartas e as facturas tratam.  Complexidade da vida! As facturas são feitas por gente Que tem amores, ódios, paixões políticas, às vezes crimes — E são tão bem escritas, tão alinhadas, tão independentes de tudo isso! Há quem olhe para uma factura e não sinta isto. Com certeza que tu, Cesário Verde, o sentias. Eu é até às lágrimas que o sinto humanissimamente. Venham dizer-me que não há poesia no comércio, nos escritórios! Ora, ela entra por todos os poros... Neste ar marítimo respiro-a, Porque tudo isto vem a propósito dos vapores, da navegação moderna, Porque as facturas e as cartas comerciais são o princípio da história E os navios que levam as mercadorias pelo mar eterno são o fim.  Ah, e as viagens, as viagens de recreio, e as outras, As viagens por mar, onde todos somos companheiros dos outros Duma maneira especial, como se um mistério marítimo Nos aproximasse as almas e nos tornasse um momento Patriotas transitórios duma mesma pátria incerta, Eternamente deslocando-se sobre a imensidade das águas! Grandes hotéis do Infinito, oh transatlânticos meus! Com o cosmopolitismo perfeito e total de nunca pararem num ponto E conterem todas as espécies de trajes, de caras, de raças!  As viagens, os viajantes — tantas espécies deles! Tanta nacionalidade sobre o mundo! tanta profissão! tanta gente! Tanto destino diverso que se pode dar à vida, Ë vida, afinal, no fundo sempre, sempre a mesma! Tantas caras curiosas! Todas as caras são curiosas E nada traz tanta religiosidade como olhar muito para gente. A fraternidade afinal não é uma ideia revolucionária. É uma coisa que a gente aprende pela vida fora, onde tem que tolerar tudo, E passa a achar graça ao que tem que tolerar, E acaba quase a chorar de ternura sobre o que tolerou!  Ah, tudo isto é belo, tudo isto é humano e anda ligado Aos sentimentos humanos, tão conviventes e burgueses. Tão complicadamente simples, tão metafisicamente tristes! A vida flutuante, diversa, acaba por nos educar no humano. Pobre gente! pobre gente toda a gente!  Despeço-me desta hora no corpo deste outro navio Que vai agora saindo. É um tramp-steamer inglês, Muito sujo, como se fosse um navio francês, Com um ar simpático de proletário dos mares, E sem dúvida anunciado ontem na última página das gazetas.  Enternece-me o pobre vapor, tão humilde vai ele e tão natural. Parece ter um certo escrúpulo não sei em quê, ser pessoa honesta, Cumpridora duma qualquer espécie de deveres. Lá vai ele deixando o lugar defronte do cais onde estou. Lá vai ele tranquilamente, passando por onde as naus estiveram Outrora, outrora... Para Cardiff? Para Liverpool? Para Londres? Não tem importância. Ele faz o seu dever. Assim façamos nós o nosso. Bela vida! Boa viagem! Boa viagem! Boa viagem, meu pobre amigo casual, que me fizeste o favor De levar contigo a febre e a tristeza dos meus sonhos, E restituir-me à vida para olhar para ti e te ver passar. Boa viagem! Boa viagem! A vida é isto...  Que aprumo tão natural, tão inevitavelmente matutino Na tua saída do porto de Lisboa, hoje! Tenho-te uma afeição curiosa e grata por isso... Por isso quê? Sei lá o que é!... Vai... Passa... Com um ligeiro estremecimento, (T-t--t---t----t-----t...) O volante dentro de mim pára.  Passa, lento vapor, passa e não fiques... Passa de mim, passa da minha vista, Vai-te de dentro do meu coração. Perde-te no Longe, no Longe, bruma de Deus, Perde-te, segue o teu destino e deixa-me... Eu quem sou para que chore e interrogue? Eu quem sou para que te fale e te ame? Eu quem sou para que me perturbe ver-te? Larga do cais, cresce o sol, ergue-se ouro, Luzem os telhados dos edifícios do cais, Todo o lado de cá da cidade brilha... Parte, deixa-me, torna-te Primeiro o navio a meio do rio, destacado e nítido, Depois o navio a caminho da barra, pequeno e preto, Depois ponto vago no horizonte (ó minha angústia!), Ponto cada vez mais vago no horizonte..., Nada depois, e só eu e a minha tristeza, E a grande cidade agora cheia de sol E a hora real e nua como um cais já sem navios, E o giro lento do guindaste que, como um compasso que gira, Traça um semicírculo de não sei que emoção No silêncio comovido da minh'alma...\\n\",\n",

Therefore space does not exist.\\nBut is it logical, is it rational to ask where space exists? Does not the word where presuppose a space? Yes and no. It presupposes a space merely because space becomes necessary to us for the conception or perception of anything, of any object. This brings the argument to where it was that space exists by itself.\\nWe do but take space as an object when we ask where it is.

Sabeis decerto que nessa (…) abandonado há lagos mais estagnados e silenciosos do que os outros lagos, e que à superfície deles bóiam, como que permanentemente, verdes folhas espalmadas, mais vulgares de ver ao pé das margens, onde se (...) entre as algas quebradas sonolentamente e como que adormecidas. É o país, decerto que vos não é estranho, em que no pôr do Sol, as horas desaparecem e o ruído do passo do tempo e os próprios sons da natureza — o zumbir de instantes e cantos de aves e o murmúrio fresco das árvores vagamente alteradas de encontro ao céu pálido nas minúcias dos seus contornos. Neste país bem o sabeis, nada disto existe. Há árvores mas não se movem Rios, riachos (...) que sejam de água corrente — não os há ali. Tudo é parado e sonolento. O sol não nasce ali, nem é nunca meio-dia ou noite naquela terra. O pôr do Sol — sumido já o sol abaixo do horizonte acima do qual nunca esteve — é eterno nesse país. De sobre os lagos escuros e esquecidos não sai nunca a vaga luz saudosa que levemente os transfigura. Não há ali ruído, nem movimento, nem vida. Bem sabeis que as próprias árvores e ervas (...) não foram nunca sementes ou (...), mas sempre assim silenciosamente como são. Movimento nenhum? Não, há um só. Ruído nenhum? Não, há um apenas. É o cair eterno das folhas amarelas no pálido sossego eterno.\\nDebalde queremos poder sonhar ninfas ou faunos entre aquelas árvores. Não as houve nunca naquela terra. Como as poderia haver? Não seria preciso que o vento acordasse, os rios começassem a correr, e as ervas fossem verdes e as folhas cessassem de cair [...]: folhas que não se vêem cair mas se sente apenas... fechados os olhos sobre aquela terra. Abertos não se vêem nem se ouvem — vêem-se apenas as folhas caídas, amarelentas no chão.\\nSim; à vista nada se move ou vive; ao ouvido apenas o que deve ser folhas caindo amarelentas decerto, naquele chão outonal que nunca foi da primavera.\\nSim, sim. Deve haver mais. Há sem dúvida um vento ligeiro, onde as folhas vêm caindo, caídas, arrastadas, paradas, revolvidas e tresmalhadas. Mas ao abrir os olhos não se vê isto. Apenas os lagos quedos e vagos de luz, e sobre distantes montanhas silenciosas o sossego eterno do dia permanentemente moribundo.\\nFoi esta a terra onde eu nasci.\\nChamo-me o Tédio — já o deveis saber.\\nNasci nessa terra sim, mas não sei porquê, nem como, nem me importa saber. Basta-me que tenha eternamente esta nostalgia dessa pátria. O mais — nada sei. Sei que nasci nessa terra, mas não me lembro de ali ter vivido nunca. Ao pé daqueles lagos nunca decerto eu estive. Aquele pôr do Sol, lembro-me dele mas não o conheço... E o cair de folhas amarelas no som? Não sei. Não o vi nunca, mas ouvi-o, e onde havia de ser senão nessa terra quando eu dormia nem sei mesmo se nela se longe dela, se de todo dormindo, se quase dormindo apenas.\\nConheceis decerto esta terra por minha. Sentis talvez como eu a nostalgia dela; e como eu talvez não desejais conhecê-la ou vê-la. Vejo-a sempre e dói-me o vê-la mas não a quero, e desejo não a ver. Mas lembro-me sempre dela; não ouso querer esquecê-la.\\nAinda que silenciosa e inerte ela não é sossegada. Nada nos diz de novo. E mais quieta do que uma casa deve ser. Parece um universo morto; uma terra a pensar; há ali pouco e muito para a alma, de menos e de mais para o sonho.\\nInclinai a cabeça sobre a mão. Pensai quanto é desejável para não viver nela esta terra estranha onde eu nasci. Não o podeis esquecer, nem querer, nem de qualquer modo sentir para com ela. Desejais como eu não é verdade? — dormir e não saber do mais. Mas, como eu, não podeis dormir. Meditais comigo eternamente naquela paisagem eterna. Fechemos os olhos ao menos; ouçamo-lo, o cair leve das folhas amarelas no entenebrecido chão. Como elas caem e rastejam em torno da nossa alma! Fechados ou abertos os olhos, elas caem sempre, bem ouvidas ou mal, ternas ou menos ternas. No mais escuro do fechar os olhos ouve-se leve o tal vento que as arrasta.\\nQue tristeza a minha, por ter nascido nessa terra; e a vossa também, por ali não ter nascido!\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'OS RAPAZES DE BARROWBY\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nOS RAPAZES DE BARROWBY\\n\\nCrónica humorística por Adolph Moscow\\n\\n1903\\n\\nCapítulo I\\n\\nA VILA E A ESCOLA DE BARROWBY\\n\\nAo escrever esta crónica verídica, luto, principalmente, com a grande desvantagem de me ser totalmente impossível apontar a localidade da célebre aldeia de Barrowby e, consequentemente, do velho colégio aí existente há poucos anos; farei todavia o melhor que puder no que diz respeito a esta história.\\nCom a louvável intenção de me informar no tocante à posição geográfica da citada povoação, tinha consultado atlas, cartas e toda a espécie de literatura que pudesse deitar luz sobre o assunto em questão. Mas debalde, depois de uma busca de seis semanas, na qual gastei o dinheiro e uma boa parte da vista (pois lia até alta noite), decidi-me a largar esta averiguação estafadora e, geralmente, inútil. Vendi, portanto, os livros e canhenhos pela décima quinta parte do que dera por eles, resolvido a perder o conhecimento da localidade de Barrowby antes que a vista ou o dinheiro, mandei a questão, que tanto me atormentara, a todos os diabos do Averno virgiliano, e deitei-me a escrever esta interessante história com o ardor dum guerreiro, a veracidade dum historiador, a determinação dum burro, e a sandice do mesmo animal, ou dum poeta da moderna escola, que são afinal bestas tão semelhantes que é praticamente impossível fazer distinção entre elas. Peço perdão ao asno por esta comparação, para ele pouco lisonjeira.\\nQuando bem reflicto sobre o caso, chego à conclusão que, afinal, todo o meu trabalho foi vão, pois que nem o local, nem o país onde estivera ou está a referida aldeia, actuaram, ou poderiam actuar sobre o curso desta extraordinária narração. É para mim perfeitamente igual se a povoação de Barrowby se tivesse achado situada na Europa, ou na Ásia, ou na África, ou na América, ou na Oceânia, ou nas profundidades caóticas do inferno dantesco. Quer tivesse a aldeia de Barrowby a sua obscura situação em qualquer dos pólos, quer sobre a linha equatorial, quer sobre qualquer dos trópicos, quer na atmosfera escassa das regiões selenocêntricas (!!!), a crónica a mesma permanecerá e como me foi dita eu a escreverei.\\nContudo, se os senhores geógrafos se esqueceram de mostrar à posteridade a exacta localidade de Barrowby, os topógrafos, mais amantes da perpetuação da fama do soberbo panorama que (diziam eles) apresentavam as esbeltas colinas e verdejantes prados que ornamentavam, realçando o efeito cénico, a casaria branca da aldeia inglesa, não se esqueceram de descrever minuciosamente a aldeia e os seus cativantes arrabaldes. Resta porém saber quem foram os amáveis descritores da Natureza que se dedicaram de tão boa vontade à inspecção cuidadosa dos encantos naturais de Barrowby. Afirmam até algumas pessoas impertinentes que será deveras difícil encontrar os citados topógrafos pela simples razão de nunca terem existido. Mas eu ponho de parte este cepticismo repugnante com o desprezo que lhe é devido, pois que tudo isto relativo à descrição topográfica da povoação e arredores me foi comunicado por pessoas de cuja integridade seria afrontoso duvidar e (entre nós) cujo único mal é nunca terem vindo ao mundo. Seja como for, pensem os leitores como quiserem pensar, a aldeia de Barrowby existirá, pelo menos, nesta crónica, e, conquanto não queira cansar os meus estimáveis leitores, devo dar-lhes a correr uma pequena ideia do lugar onde se vão desenrolar as cenas desta variegada crónica. Suponhamos, todavia, que a aldeia de Barrowby se encontrava a duas léguas dum porto, perto de Brighton em Inglaterra, e ao qual chamaremos Lynmouth. Passemos à descrição de Barrowby.\\nEntre duas colinas, subdivididas em mais de oito colinas pequenas ou simples montões, estava a povoação de que estamos a falar. As colinas pequenas (ou montões grandes) eram regulares e nada escabrosas, com a excepção duma chamada a Ribanceira do Pinhal, pela razão de ter em tempos havido um pinhal na mais regular das suas rasgadas encostas. Esta colina, a que mais direito tinha a ser considerada como uma colina especial ou separada, era tão íngreme e rasgada que ninguém conseguira (até ao momento em que começa a minha história) trepar até ao cume, apesar de bastantes terem feito atentados.\\n\\nO plano que acompanha estas linhas mostra melhor a posição da vila, colégio e tudo mais de interesse nesta história. No lugar marcado N, sobre o rio, estava a vila, o colégio de Barrowby no extremo O e um outro colégio superior em P. Em Q era a casa dum oficial reformado — o Almirante Saca-Rolhas e em R era a casa de Sir Rogério Cabaça, uma pessoa importantíssima, mas por que razão ninguém sabia. De qualquer outro lugar se falará no curso da história. Por agora bastam os que se vêem no plano.\\nA vila, ou aldeia, de Barrowby era como quase todas as aldeias pequenas, muito branca, muito quieta e bastante pitoresca. Como é do Colégio que nos vamos ocupar, trataremos de o descrever em primeiro lugar.\\nContando, naquela data, trinta anos de construído, tinha passado pelas mãos de nada menos de cinco administradores. Erigido no local de um velho convento, havia ainda por baixo do colégio umas celas subterrâneas e uns claustros escuríssimos e duma antiguidade insondável que contrastavam flagrantemente com a estrutura modernizada do colégio.\\nO colégio continha, em primeiro lugar, a casa do administrador, o Reverendo Doutor Sabido, um homem inteligentíssimo, formado em Literatura e Teologia; da sua mulher, uma senhora de cara cadavérica, de corpo cadavérico, e cuja presença e conversação punham um ar cadavérico à mais brilhante e alegre das pessoas; e de suas duas filhas que herdavam da mãe a fealdade de cara e corpo e o tal ar de mortas-vivas, e do pai a jactância e pompa, mas não a sabedoria e delicadeza, qualidades quase inatas no Reverendo Doutor, que se prezava de já saber ler antes de ter nascido. Eu não quero duvidar da palavra do Doutor Sabido, mas isto parece um fenómeno fora do poder da ciência moderna: seja como for, aí fica o dito; os leitores que pensem dele o que quiserem .\\nA casa do Administrador Reverendo Doutor Sabido era ligada ao colégio próprio por um corredor no rés-de-chão que ia dar direito à aula principal, ou antes, maior. O colégio próprio continha no rés-do-chão mais umas poucas de aulas, um ginásio, um laboratório, um quarto para leituras de física, e outras divisões necessárias.\\nO primeiro andar tinha os três dormitórios, que eram só para os rapazes mais pequenos, e outros quartos separados, habitados cada um por dois ou três rapazes grandes; havia também no fim uns quartos de criados e outras divisões precisas. No segundo andar havia os quartos de cama e saletas dos professores restantes e a casa de jantar de todos do colégio, com excepção, já se vê, dos criados. Acima de tudo havia um observatório astronómico, onde os professores passavam as noites às vezes absortos na contemplação dos astros nocturnos. O terreno do colégio, mesmo excluindo o grande jardim do Doutor (que era o nome pelo qual era conhecido o Administrador), era enorme comparado com os pátios dos colégios urbanos.\\nAí fica a descrição do Colégio de Barrowby. Voltemos agora à nossa história.\\n\\nCapítulo II\\n\\nOS RECÉM-CHEGADOS\\n\\nEra um dia quente no princípio de Agosto; abria, depois do costumado mês de férias, o Colégio de Barrowby, que, digamo-lo aqui, era só para internos.\\nSó no dia seguinte é que a escola abria realmente, pois que o dia de que falo era aquele em que deviam chegar todos os rapazes.\\nDefronte da grande porta do Colégio estavam agrupados três rapazes alegres e saudáveis, discutindo vivamente e contando uns aos outros as peripécias que tinham feito nas férias. Descrevamo-los.\\n\\nO primeiro, o mais alto de todos, era um rapaz de quinze anos e meio, crescido para a sua idade, e a frescura e vermelhidão sadia de cujo rosto o proclamavam como criado nos campos. Tinha ele o carácter dum verdadeiro rapaz inglês; qualquer hábil discípulo de Lavater poder-lhe-ia ler na cara coragem e travessura, nos olhos azuis franqueza e, se fosse discípulo de Kisch\\n\\n (1) \\n\\xa0(1), a força de carácter e de vontade e aquela determinação característica dos ingleses no cabelo louro. Chamava-se Henry Ford e era filho de um titular, magnate provincial que, quando não estava na House of Lords (Câmara inglesa dos Pares), andava caçando a raposa. É verdade que Henry Ford era o nome do rapaz, mas ninguém, com excepção dos mestres, o tratava por Ford; chamavam-lhe Mel, por ele ser muito amigo de doces e artigos de confeitaria.\\n\\nO segundo rapaz era chinês e tinha só doze anos. A sua cara era mais bonita e fina que geralmente são as fisionomias dos filhos do Império Oriental. Chamava-se Lung-Hi e era filho de um mandarim que o mandava à escola na Europa pois que o destinava à representação do seu país na Inglaterra. Este pequeno era o mais baixo de todos, mas era o mais vivo e mais travesso do bando ali reunido. Nos colégios ingleses nobreza é posta à parte (2) e tratavam-no os professores pelo seu nome simplesmente, e os rapazes por Lung só.\\n\\nO terceiro rapaz era mais baixo que o primeiro, mas mais alto que o príncipe china, pois que este era o verdadeiro título do Oriental. Tinha cabelo louro quase castanho e a sua fisionomia exprimia mais travessura mas era menos aberta que a do Mel. Chamava-se este Godfrey Slater, mas tinha a alcunha de Gyp, abreviatura de \\n\\ngypsy \\n\\n(cigano), porque ele se entendia muito bem com ciganos.\\n\\nAcabava de chegar o príncipe e apertava alegremente as mãos aos companheiros.\\n«Então», disse ele, «há rapazes novos?»\\n«Aí estão três», respondeu Gyp; «um tem cara de burro, outro nariz de cegonha e o terceiro boca de tubarão podre.»\\n«Assim não se faz ideia nenhuma deles», disse Lung-Hi.\\n«Mas faz-se vendo-os», replicou Mel, «e aí vêm eles todos.»\\nTrês rapazes, olhando para tudo ares de pessoas com que ali estão pela primeira vez, pararam à porta. O primeiro, que fora descrito por Gyp como «nariz de cegonha», era um judeu e trazia três anéis de ouro falso com brilhantes falsos, um alfinete de gravata de latão pintado de amarelo com um vidro verde a imitar uma esmeralda, e um relógio e corrente de prata falsa. Chamava-se esta prenda Zacarias Phumtumpum. Os outros dois rapazes eram tipos muito comuns para precisar descrição; chamava-se, o maior, Long; e o mais pequeno, Poll. Todos estes três olharam para Lung, Mel e Gyp.\\n«Ih! Nariz de proa de galera romana, para quem estás tu a olhar assim?», disse para o judeu o nosso amigo Gyp, que tinha uma língua muito severa que, como sabia jogar bem o soco (3), ele usava indiscriminadamente.\\n«Eu não quero fazer mal», respondeu assustado Zacarias.\\n\\n«Então tira a tua cara daqui, que ela era capaz de assustar um rinoceronte, quanto mais um \\n\\ngentleman \\n\\ninglês», retorquiu Gyp com o sobrecenho carregado.\\n\\n«Eu só queria perguntar o caminho p-p-para o d-d-dormitório», disse tremendo o judeu\\n«Ah! Eh! Ih! Oh! Uh!», foi a resposta de Gyp, que tirou da algibeira um caderno e um lápis e se deu um ar importante; «eu sou uma pessoa importante aqui no colégio e quero saber que diabo queres ir fazer lá acima ao dormitório.» Gyp fez uma cara severa e pareceu disposto a escrever. Parecia assim um polícia tomando notas.\\n«Eu t-t-t p-p-p r-r-r a-a-a-a- e-e», explicou Zacarias aterrorizado.\\n«Entendeste?», perguntou Mel, rindo a bandeiras despregadas.\\n«Explica-te», berrou Gyp para o judeu. Como este não se explicou, Gyp deu-lhe um murro no nariz e disse-lhe com um ar importante que por esta vez o deixaria ir livre de castigo, pois que era um rapaz novo. O judeu muito contente desapareceu com os companheiros.\\n«Que chamas a estes?», perguntou Gyp aos companheiros.\\n«Bestinhas», respondeu Mel com um gesto de desdém.\\n«Criancinhas», foi a explicação do china que, fiel ao recreio do seu país, foi brincar com um papagaio (de papel, não o pássaro).\\nNeste momento chegou outro rapaz ao qual os outros chamaram Don. Tinha cabelo escuro e era pela altura de Gyp. O seu verdadeiro nome era Donald Dowson, e Don era abreviatura do seu primeiro nome. Vinha com um irmão gémeo chamado Ricardo, e, familiarmente, Dick.\\nOs colégios ingleses são divididos em casas unidas por um corredor. No Colégio de Barrowby havia duas, presididas cada uma por um professor. «Don» Dowson pertencia à casa maior, do Senhor Pedra, e o seu gémeo à casa mais pequena — a do Senhor Silva. Don Dowson, Mel, Gyp e o China habitavam um quarto separado (um daqueles a que acima me referi).\\nDon estava conversando com Mel e Gyp quando entrou no terreno pela cancela um rapaz um pouco alto (mas não tão alto como Mel), muito magro e com uma cara muito esquisita e ainda mais cadavérica que a da senhora do Doutor e das suas filhas. Chegou este recém-chegado ao pé da porta e perguntou, dirigindo-se a Gyp com um desembaraço admirável, onde era a casa do administrador.\\n«Procura tu, cara de garrafa partida», disse zangado Gyp.\\n«Agradecido, olhos de janela», respondeu o recém-vindo sem se agitar, referindo-se aos óculos de Gyp. Ia entrando, quando Gyp o parou.\\n«Olha cá», retorquiu Gyp, tirando os óculos para brigar, e chegando a sua cara ao pé da do rapaz novo, de maneira que havia só a distância de dois centímetros entre o seu nariz e o do magrizela, «nós não queremos um pedaço de tripa podre neste colégio. Ouves?»\\n«Tendo ouvidos, é natural... E, ouve cá; se não querem aqui um pedaço de tripa, por que é que te não vais embora?»\\nMel e Don sorriram; em batalha de espírito vencia facilmente o recém-vindo, cujo nome era Ralph Tig. Vendo que assim nada ganhava, Gyp perguntou a Tig se queria brigar ao soco com ele.\\n«Com muito prazer», disse Tig tão calmamente que Gyp, que esperara medo, ficou um tanto confuso.\\n«Agarra aqui no meu chapéu, Mel», pediu Gyp: «vou-lhe ensinar a não ser atrevido.»\\nGyp atirou-se a Tig, e atirou-lhe um murro à cabeca. Tig esquivou-se agilmente para o lado, e a mão fechada de Gyp deu de encontro à parede com tal força que pareceu ao infeliz dador do soco que se lhe partiam as falanges de todos os dedos. Tig aproveitou a consternação do seu adversário e deu-lhe um soco no nariz que fez as lágrimas subirem-lhe aos olhos. Mel e Don, que tinham Gyp como pugilista insigne, ficaram embasbacados. Gyp, enfurecido pela desfeita e pela dor, avançou para Tig e quis bater-lhe no estômago com a mão esquerda, pois que a direita doía-lhe muito. Mas Tig saltou para trás e o murro valente de Gyp perdeu-se no ar. O ímpeto causado pelo soco na atmosfera fez Gyp avançar, sem se poder parar, até ao pé do seu antagonista. Com a rapidez dum relâmpago, este deu-lhe um murro no olho esquerdo e depois um no direito, e, quando Gyp, cegado pelas pancadas, ousou levantar a cabeça, fê-lo trincar a língua com um soco nos queixos. Para evitar mais pancadas enquanto não pudesse ver bem, Gyp saltou para trás, mas até nisto foi infeliz. Os seus pés caíram sobre uma casca de banana que ali fora deixada por algum rapaz. Os pés levantaram-se-lhe do chão com uma velocidade espantosa e, batendo na barriga de Mel que estava atrás, fizeram-no cair por baixo de Gyp, que, infelizmente, lhe caiu sentado sobre a sua boca. Don, que se tinha posto a uma distancia respeitável, ria sem parar.\\n(Ilustrações no Próximo N.º).

Conservou este porém o chapéu na cabeça.

E os mesmos sentidos, com que transfiro a meditação para esquecê-la, são uma espécie de sono, qualquer coisa de remoto e de sequaz, interstício, diferença, acaso das sombras e da confusão.\\nNesses momentos, em que compreenderia os ascetas e os retirados, se houvesse em mim poder de compreender os que se empenham em qualquer esforço com fins absolutos, ou em qualquer crença capaz de produzir um esforço, eu criaria, se pudesse, toda uma estética da desconsolação, uma rítmica íntima de balada de berço, coada pelas ternuras da noite em grandes afastamentos de outros lares.\\n',\n",

Le relêvement rituel du candidat marque le premier passage, et \\n\\nl'instinct \\n\\nest la parole qu'il a perdue. L'ouverture du tombeau de C[hristian] R[osenkreutz] marque le deuxiême passage: en voyant le livre T, que le Second Maître serre contre la poitrine, on trouve enfim \\n\\nl'intuition, \\n\\nsoit la parole dans son êtat humain, car l'intuition est l'instinct de l'intelligence, le mariage de ces deux dans des «noces chimiques» dont on a décrit ailleurs, en langage symbolique les grades, ou marches, magiques. La découverte, \\n\\nsans cherche ni difficulté, \\n\\ndu tombeau de Jesus, ouvert et vide, marque le passage final, le mariage divin, celui de l'intuition avec la profondeur même de l'âme, l'union avec le Christ.\\n\\nDans le premier grade de cette vraie initiation le candidat a la tâche de tuer (en soi) les trois assassins du Maître, les trois éléments qui s'opposent (en lui) à la Loi de Nature - le désir du superflu, la croyance à la science et l'impulsion de dominer (la volonté de pouvoir, de Nietzsche); ou, dans un langage plus simple, l'ambition, l'orgueil et la vanité. Cela, du reste, lui est déjá obscurément indiqué, au commencement même de sa vie initiatique, quand il est dépouillé de métaux. Il est dépouillé, techniquement, du fer (armes), de I'argent (qui est la monnaie qui achête) et de l'or (qui est la monnaie qui éblouit) - métaux régis, respectivement, par Mars, Lune et Soleil, significateurs de l'ambition, de la vanité et de l'orgueil. Quand les trois assassins sont tués dans l'âme de l'aspirant, il est prêt pour l'avancement.\\nDans le deuxiême grade de cette ascension vers Dieu, la tâche du candidat est de retrouver la parole. Pour cela il faut qu'il fasse trois choses: qu'il trouve oú est située Ia voûte mortuaire de C[hristian] R[osenkreutz], qu'il ouvre cette voûte, qu'il ouvre le tombeau et y voit le Maître Parfait, qui porte la Parole contre son sein - ce Livre T (Templi) qui en même temps complête et s'oppose au Livre M (Mundi). Il faut d'abord qu'il sache qu'il est en lui une voûte ou est logée son âme supérieure morte en ce monde. Il faut, ensuite, qu'il la trouve. Il faut, après, qu'il sache ouvrir cette voûte. Il faut, encore, qu'il sache regarder bien ce qu'il y voit. Il faut, finalement, qu'il sache ouvrir le tombeau du Maître et le voir dans la majesté de sa mort vive, incorruptible. Ce sont les cinq points parfais de la grande maîtrise, [les cinq pointes de l'étoile magique, les cinq pétales de la Rose crucifiée.] Par eux il est relevé de cette vie, qui n'est qu'une mort figurative.\\n\\nL'homme n'était pas destiné à être ce qu'il est: il n'est devenu tel que par la Chute. Retrouver la Parole c'est retrouver la vraie Loi Humaine, l'Adam primitif et androgyne, fait ainsi à l'image de Elohim. Faire en soi même le mariage des deux principes - c'est là la Loi Humaine retrouvée, la vraie création de la pierre philosophale.\\nHiram est l'Homme qui devrait être et sa Parole était cette destinée qui s'est perdue. Nous pourrons retrouver la Parole, non pas retrouver Hiram. Il est vraiment mort, et c'est là le peché originel; nous ne pourrons nous en défaire qu'en nous régénérant, soit en naissant à nouveau. Tel est le sens du mot «néophyte».\\n\",\n",

Não quer dizer o mistério da morte, que não penetro, mas a sensação física de cessar de viver. A humanidade tem medo da morte, mas incertamente o homem normal bate-se bem em exercício, o homem normal, doente ou velho, raras vezes olha com horror o abismo do nada que ele atribui a esse abismo. Tudo isso é falta de imaginação. Nem há nada menos de quem pensa que supor a morte um sono. Porque o há-de ser se a morte se não assemelha ao sono? O essencial do sono é o acordar-se dele, e da morte, supomos, não se acorda. E se a morte se assemelha. ao sono, deveremos ter a noção de que se acorda dela. Não é isso porém, o que o homem normal se figura: figura para si a morte como um sono de que não se acorda, o que nada quer dizer. A morte, disse não se assemelha ao sono, pois no sono se está vivo e dormindo; nem sei como pode alguém assemelhar a morte a qualquer coisa, pois não pode ter experiência dela, ou coisa com que a comparar.\\n\\nA mim, quando vejo um morto, a morte parece-me uma partida O cadáver dá-me a impressão de um trajo que se deixou.

       "  'text': \"\\nNovembro 1915\\n……\\n15 - Morning began with small disillusion: negative answer from Guimarães and Co (but good because of incompleteness of pamphlet). Day ran on fairly agreeably, with curious small (but subjective) «suspicions», of even slight importance. Between 3 and 4 p. m. received unexpectedly 1 1/2 dollars from Senchi [?] for typing his translations. Day ended well at the Hotel with Aunt Lisbella; [...] except [...] and talkative, made myself agreeable to her and niece, evidently. In early morning 16 (about between 2 and 5) great mental excitement, excellent and important philosophical ideas, completing part my system. Physically uncomfortable, flatulence. Mixture of megalomania and religious ideas (in no way attacking lucidity). Slept at 5 1/2 till about 11 or l6th. This night bit was a remarkable one for mental action. (On coming home at about 11 1/2 p. m. I had slight curious «spirit» terrors.)16 - Got up late, near 11 a. m., as above up to about 4 was ever more or less hazy on account of this. At office good thing: last proofs of D. of R. had arrived: hence solution Aunt Car's question. These proofs, unexpected, wearying. - Could not receive money this evening, however, having arrived necessarily late. - Read Caeiro and R. Reis to Raul Leal: he seemed to like very much and to understand: so good moments. Walked about with Brito, talking aimlessly about «Orpheu». Dined at 9 1/2. Home immediately after. Smoked far less, by will, and by natural effect of it. On the whole an agreeable day. (In morning besides good news in proofs, also agreeable news in Sol's letter, when it refers to Hermano Neves).\\n……\\n22 - Same kind of thing, rather agreeable, especially at night, when was very lucid and easy in talk. At night, in semiconsciousness, Janus.\\n23 - Sarne kind of thing. Worked a little on translation. Same financial fix.\\n24 - Began same as above, but bettered in afternoon (between 3 and 5) when earned 1 dollar from Franco. The night was very pleasant; mind clear. [...] on going home (about 10:30) a considerable depression fell on me, a wish to express it in writing but an incapacity to do so.\\n25 - Awoke with sore throat, but this passed. A day lost and not disagreeably, except in so far as known as lost.\\n26 - A very curious mystical day. Met Cesar Porto. Made the acquaintance (really reacquaintance, though better now), casually, in Livraria Monteiro, of [...]:\\nlikes of Orpheu, etc. Lost all time for translation. Had 3 times during day and night fits of a curious form of dizziness - an abstract physical kind; but was all day lucid. Smoked a lot. [...] The day was intensely agreable except as lost. At night, long and very pleasant conversation w[ith] Leonardo Coimbra.\\n……\\n29 - A more or less happy and interesting day. Suddenly solved question of M's money by borrowing from him 10 dollars (+ for books) till 7th December. The translation came in, which was easy. A slightly fervent state, but not hurtful, and very slight - met Leal and was glad. At night with Aunt Lisbella at hotel, very pleasant; made eyes with a rather interesting girl who seemed to like me. Felt myself agreeable with them (her and perhaps a sister), though I said little... the Emperor [?], alas!\\n30 - Day practically wasted, yet agreeable, both because, in spite of a little rain, the sky was blue and fine, and because life ran agreeably. At night was pleased to hear 2 soft references (Cortes-Rodrigues and Perdigão) to my being well-dressed (Oh! me?) and passed a pleasant 1 1/2 hour at hotel making still more eyes (and exchanging) with the girl (17-years old, excellent) and seemed agreeable to her, her sister and even her deaf mother. Spoke to her quite easily and at her eyes even. Alas!...\\n\\nDezembro 1\\n……\\n6 - Disagreeable day because had a lot of heavy rain on me, crumpling suit, had to wait 1/2 hour in a roadway, and also because translation progressed very little. Yet a short visit during the day to the hotel was good because had to stop very little (owing to retum to office), and thus not bored, and the little girl's sweetness was not all gone, yet my absence was 3 days. Aunt L[isbella] had thought it was on account of my being offended with her at «pôr-me na rua» playfully several nights before... This amusing and agreeable, because of her thinking possible and worrying at it. - A very great depression at night, hardly any money and very much depressed. So much that, on strenght of it began writing letter to Sá-Carneiro and interrupted it, through lack of will to write. (Also waited for Guisado long time and he did not appear).\\n7 - Better, better. Day better, first. Then worked fairly well, later translation and office (15 letters). No depression; rather the beginning of clear thought, occultistly anti-theosophical. V. Braga, in morning, spoke to me of Coelho de Carvalho's wish for me to translate Faust: but, alas!, gain is hypothetical and afterwards!\\n\",\n",

O que não temos, ou não ousamos, ou não conseguimos, podemos possuí-lo em sonho, e é com esse sonho que fazemos arte.

It is natural to say that the 20th century has found its poet for no other reason than this - that the extraordinary originality of this poet happens in the 20th century. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in relation to its time is, if anything, less original than A.C.'s astonishing volume - The Keeper of Sheep - (O G[uardador] de R[ebanhos]) which has just appeared in Lisbon.\\nNo one in P[ortuguese] literary milieux had ever heard of him. He appeared suddenly. And his contribution to Portuguese, and European literature, breaks away, as we have said, from all truths and currents that were valid in the past or are active today.\\nA.C. is the poet of absolute materialism. This is his first originality; there never was, properly speaking, a poet of materialism... The second creation is that C. puts into his absolute materialism a poetical colour and intensity which we have been accustomed to find only in the highest spiritualistic poetry.\\n\",\n",

Li-o aqui, a esta janela, como ele o quereria, tendo diante dos meus olhos extasiados o (...) da baía de Vigo. E não posso ter senão por providencial que um acaso feliz me proporcionasse, tão cedo empós a leitura, travar conhecimento com o poeta glorioso.\\nApresentou-nos um amigo comum. E à noite, ao jantar, na sala (...) do Hotel (...), eu tive com o poeta esta conversa, que eu ansiei poder converter-se em entrevista.\\nEu dissera-lhe da minha admiração perante a sua obra. Ele escutára-me como quem recebe o que lhe é devido, com aquele orgulho espantoso e fresco que é um dos maiores atractivos do homem, por quem, de supor é, lhe reconheça o direito a ele. E ninguém mais do que eu lho reconhece. Extraordinariamente lho reconhece.\\nSobre o café a conversa pôde intelectualizar-se por completo. Consegui levá-la, sem custo, para um único ponto, o que me interessava, o livro de Caeiro. Pude ouvir-lhe as opiniões que transcrevo, e que, não sendo, claro é, toda a conversa, muito representam, contudo, do que se disse.\\nO poeta fala de si e da sua obra com uma espécie de religiosidade e de natural elevação que, talvez, noutros com menos direitos a falar assim, parecessem francamente insuportáveis.

They express five concepts of the world, considered through the sexual emotion, and are thus weltanschauungen of the instinctive.\\nThe first poem, Antinous, represents the Greek concept of the sexual world. Like all primitive concepts, it is elaborate; like all innocent concepts, it is substantially perverse. That it may show up as primitive, the emotion depicted is purposely a non-primitive one; that it may blossom as innocent, it is developed into a metaphysics, but, as is right in innocence, the metaphysics is added to, not put into, the substance of the main theme.\\nThe second poem, Epithalamium, represents the Roman concept of the sexual world. It is brutal, like all colonial emotion; bestial, like all natural things, when they are secondary, as they were with men like the Romans, who were animals guarding a state. In this poem there is no metaphysics. In this poem there could be no perversity. The setting, as in Antinous, has no converse with the theme. A normal Christian marriage is the setting; against that dull black scenario the animalism of the Roman instinct is made to stand out like a naked monster born of the world.\\nThe third poem, Prayer to a Woman's Body, represents the Christian concept of the sexual world. It has nothing to do with the Christian concept of the world itself, as, indeed, the normal Christian has nothing to do with it. The confusion of the sensual and of the spiritual, which the Christian mystics apply to saints of the other sex, (...)\\n\",\n",

       "  'text': '\\nQuerido Mestre:\\n\\nQuando decidimos conjugar os nossos esforços para iniciar uma renascença neoclássica na Europa, mal sabíamos que a vontade de Júpiter de nascença nos havia fadado para assim nos conjugarmos. Para produzir esse movimento mister era não só que houvesse uma reconstituição da alma antiga, mas, mais, porque se não podia simplesmente transplantar para hoje o sentimento pagão, dar a essa renascença uma base metafísica. Uma renascença clássica queria dizer, para nós, uma continuação da tradição grega. E uma continuação da trad[ição] grega queria dizer um alargamento e renovação da própria tradição grega, feitos dentro dos princípios eternos do espírito que preside ao helenismo.\\nPara o papel aparentemente principal de recondutor da alma pagã, sabeis bem que o Fado me fizera nascer. Excuso de vos falar de como eu sou de meu espontâneo ser, um crente verdadeiro e profundo na existência dos deuses imortais. Sabeis bem como, para mim, Júpiter, Vénus, Apolo e as mais presenças imorredouras que presidem à nossa vida transitória, são realidades e existências concretas. Agradeço-vos ainda o não vos ter custado a acreditar que [sou] verdadeiramente um crente verdadeiro nos deuses. Seria natural que julgásseis isto uma atitude poética. Estranho parece a um homem de hoje, - crente que seja no deus chamado Jesus, - que alguém com ele coexista que realmente sinta a existência de Júpiter, de Apolo, das amazonas [?], das nereidas, dos faunos e dos silenos.\\n\\nSeparou-nos, no espaço e na duração da vida, aquele que é superior aos próprios deuses, o Fado mas a vontade sincrética dos deuses segue o seu caminho dentro de nós. Aproximou-nos mais o nosso destino sinérgico. E ao passo que se aperfeiçoava em vós a nossa lúcida e nova visão do universo, completava-se em mim a posse inteira e desterrada dos deuses cuja ideia foi a aspiração da minha infância e a estalagem - da minha idade viril.\\nTrazíeis vós ao turbulento movimento literário português todo o Universo que estava dentro de nós. Mais humilde, eu trazia, Mestre, a re-visão lúcida dos deuses, a renascida crença antiga, que o turbilhão de falsos deuses cristãos, santos de seu nome, havia sepulto.\\n\\nDo nosso unido esforço nascerá decerto o primeiro impulso da Nova Renascença. Nunca tivemos a ilusão da humildade, nem julgámos a nossa arte com um olhar menos nobre e altivo que o que Milton deve ter tido para as primeiras páginas do seu Paraíso Perdido, para a clássica escultura do seu \\n\\nSansão Agonistes. \\n\\nNunca nos enganaram, a mim, os Corneilles e os Racines do classicismo dos inferiores; a vós os materialistas estéreis e secos da nossa (...) civilização.\\n\\nSabíamos de sobra o quanto houve de estéril em querer erguer uma arte clássica sem primeiro varrer de cima dos nossos sentimentos todo o lixo com que o cristianismo os cobriu. Os Corneilles e os Racines nunca nos enganaram. Não confundimos nunca a secura da alma com a calma posse de nós-próprios, nem a incapacidade de sentir com a disciplina poderosa e espontânea dos próprios sentimentos. Por instinto vós, e eu pela minha educação, sobreposta a esse instinto também, fizemos esse erro de acreditarmos que haveria clássicos e gregos aqui da Grécia ou talvez de Roma.\\nNesta suja e estéril república longínqua tudo é de jeito a cada vez mais, por uma reacção, me dar paganismo. Os meus pensamentos vão todos para essa paisagem lúcida e calma de Portugal, tão naturalmente predestinada a produzir os homens que tomarão das mãos longínquas dos gregos o facho do sentimento pagão (Naturalista).\\n',\n",

Nem a narrativa dessa vida auxiliaria o entendimento da obra, que poucas raízes tem na história pessoal do homem, que a escreveu; nem essa história, a ser contada, esclareceria, não já por causa, mas por paralelo, a obra feita.\\nQue tem esta obra com o que houve na vida do poeta? Qualquer campo é o campo que ele viu; qualquer amor o amor breve que deixou de si nos dois poemas de «O Pastor Amoroso», únicos no mundo neste género; qualquer fim de vida, com a tristeza do seu sentido, dá a quebra da força artística, a turbação da quietude substantiva que, por vezes, na terceira parte do livro, se deixa revelar.

Não é a crueldade de todos aqueles mortos e feridos, o sacrifício de todos os que morrem batendo-se, ou são mortos sem que se batam, que pesa duramente na alma: é a estupidez que sacrifica vidas e haveres a qualquer coisa inevitavelmente inútil. Todos os ideais e todas as ambições são um desvairo de comadres homens. Não há império que valha que por ele se parta uma boneca de criança. Não há ideal que mereça o sacrificio de um comboio de lata. Que império é útil ou que ideal profícuo? Tudo é humanidade, e a humanidade é sempre a mesma — variável mas inaperfeiçoável, oscilante mas improgressiva. Perante o curso inimplorável das coisas, a vida que tivemos sem saber como e perderemos sem saber quando, o jogo de dez mil xadrezes que é a vida em comum e luta, o tédio de contemplar sem utilidade o que se não realiza nunca (...) — que pode fazer o sábio senão pedir o repouso, o não ter que pensar em viver, pois basta ter que viver, um pouco de lugar ao sol e ao ar e ao menos o sonho de que há paz do lado de lá dos montes.\\n',\n",

O poeta amou porque amou, e não porque há amor, e foi isso mesmo que disse.\\n«O Guardador de Rebanhos» é a vida mental de Caeiro até a diligência levantar no alto da estrada. Os «Poemas Inconjuntos» são já a descida. Distingo assim, para mim próprio: há poemas dos «P[oemas] I[nconjuntos]» que eu imagino que talvez pudesse ter escrito. Não há giro da minha imaginação que me faça passar pelo sonho de poder ter escrito qualquer poema de «O G[uardador] de Rebanhos».\\nNos poemas inconjuntos há cansaço, e portanto diferença. Caeiro é Caeiro, mas Caeiro doente. Nem sempre doente, mas às vezes doente. Idêntico mas um pouco alheado. Isto aplica-se sobretudo aos poemas médios dessa terceira parte da sua obra.\\n',\n",

Há abatimentos da alma abaixo de toda a angústia e de toda a dor; creio que os não conhecem senão os que se furtam às angústias e às dores humanas, e têm diplomacia consigo mesmos para se esquivar ao próprio tédio. Reduzindo-se, assim, a seres couraçados contra o mundo, não admira que, em certa altura da sua consciência de si-mesmos, lhes pese de repente o vulto inteiro da couraça, e a vida lhes seja uma angústia às avessas, uma dor perdida.\\n\\nEstou em um desses momentos, e escrevo estas linhas como quem quer ao menos saber que vive.

Nem olho o dia, e ignoro com as costas dobradas se é sol ou falta de sol o que está lá fora na rua subjectivamente triste, na rua deserta onde está passando o som de gente. Ignoro tudo e dói-me o peito. Parei de trabalhar e não quero mexer-me daqui. Estou olhando para o mata-borrão branco sujo, que alastra, pregado aos cantos, por sobre a grande idade da secretária inclinada. Fito atentamente os rabiscos de absorção e distracção que estão borrados nele. Várias vezes a minha assinatura às avessas e ao invés. Alguns números aqui e ali, assim mesmo. Uns desenhos de nada, feitos pela minha desatenção. Olho a tudo isto como um aldeão de mata-borrões, com uma atenção de quem olha novidades, com todo o cérebro inerte por detrás dos centros cerebrais que promovem a visão.\\n\\nTenho mais sono íntimo do que cabe em mim.

La neurasthénie vulgaire, ou les influences qui la produirent tombant sur un fonds de dégénérescence a, pour ainsi dire, bouleversé une organization mentale characteristiquement hysteriforme, pour ne pas dire hysterique. Sur ce diagnostique, je ne me trouve pas en doute. Ce que je voudrais faire, c'est l'histoire \\n\\nde la maladie \\n\\nde P[essoa], ou, pour mieux dire, l’histoire (...) - je voudrais en connaître la psychologie, savoir de quelle manière, par quels conduits la neurasthénie actuelle s'est enracinée dans ce pauvre temperament nativement hyposthénique.\\n\\nOr pour cette «histoire d'une vie» ou «histoire d'une âme» les donnés me manquent. Je connais, dans les limites du possible, la vie mentale de P[essoa] jusqu'à 1895 (décembre), époque à laquelle il est allé (agé à peine de 7 ans) à D'Urban. Elle n'est pas absolument normale. À cette âge il y a déjá chez l'observé une espèce de neurasthenabilité marquée: à 7 ans - c'est déjá -quoique obscurement - un peridyspéptique, un (...). Plus, à 7 ans P[essoa] montre déjá ce caractère réservé, non-infantile - une pondération (non la pondération du bon-sens tout à fait bourgeois, mais la pondération melancolique et intellectuelle), une seriosité, qui étonnent. Il s'isole déjà; il aime à jouer seul, à lire, à écrire (il l'a appris lui-même). C’est un solitaire - on le voit bien. Et à tout cela il faut joindre beaucoup de rage impulsive et presqu'haineuse (sans provocation pas toujours proportionelle) et beaucoup de peur. On peut résumer le caractère: précocité intellectuelle, imagination prématurément intense, méchanceté, peur, besoin d'isolement. C'est un neuropathe em miniature.\\n\\nProbablement il aura ainsi continué pour quelque temps. En 1901 (août) il revint de D'Urban. C'est le même caractère, mais moins impulsif: le climat (je conjecture) et la discipline scolaire l'auraient inhibitionnés. À cette époque il présente un caractère pas trop complexe: intelligence vive, imagination grande mais pas necessairement \\n\\nintense; \\n\\nun peu enfantile (...) pas de peur \\n\\naccentuée \\n\\n-\\n\\n \\n\\nc'est à dire, sans claire provocation extérieure il ne la montre pas. C'est encore normal, physiologique. Du reste, timidité, ingénuité, égoisme un peu marqué - mais le tout normal. Ce n'est pas encore l'aube de la puberté. Ayant vécu dans un pays (le Natal) loin de l'influence corruptrice de la civilization, il n'a pas de depucellage \\n\\nmental; \\n\\nà cette époque il garde mentalement (à ce que je crois) une virginité d'imagination parfaite. II n'y a pas, d'ailleurs, moyen sur d'investigation.\\n\\nII est resté à Lisbonne de Août 1901 jusqu'à Sept[embre] 1902; il faut donc qu'il ait subi tant soit peu l'influence de la sensualité urbaine et immoralement corruptrice.\\nMais il m'a été entièrement impossible de trouver un moyen quelconque de découvrir (...)\\n\",\n",

       "  'text': \"\\nHavia dias que andava exaltado, turgido de alma.\\nLembrou-lhe de repente que alguma coisa havia de significativo em ele das duas vezes que se quisera suicidar, ter falhado. Não haveria ali oculto fim, senão directa indicação da Providência, fosse como fosse? Não lhe indicava isso que ele devia viver, que tinha o dever de usar a sua compaixão, a sua mágoa pela infelicidade humana [?] Era - com que nitidez percebia agora a indicação providencial das circunstâncias - uma missão que lhe era imposta na vida, na terra, no sistema do mundo... Missão como a de Buda, como a de Cristo, de paz, de clemência e amor... Os seus sonhos antigos, eram - com que saliência explicativa o via agora - previsões e não sonhos ou desejos... Talvez o martírio o esperasse; ainda bem... Sentia-se forte, audaz para combater o mal...\\nVinham-lhe lacrimosamente grandes impulsos de ternura humana, em que, a sós no quarto, passeando excitado de lado a lado rompia em longo e sincero choro ao pensar nas criancinhas sem pão, nas criancinhas condenadas a ser prostituídas, nas injustiças do mundo... Assomavam-lhe então loucas e desmedidas ambições de ser um novo Cristo, de pregar no mundo com toda a intensidade do seu amor, a piedade para com todos, o amor sublime e eterno da triste e sofredora humanidade... Via-se, em visões de lucidez quase objectiva, o Messias de uma fé nova, a mesma ainda assim do que o cristianismo, como que uma ressurreição dele, via-se pregando e comovia-se ao ouvir o que nessa visão dizia, imaginava-se enfim desdenhado e perdoando, odiado e amando os que o odiavam, - com que nitidez d'alma se via dando o pão ao seu inimigo, velando à cabeceira do leito da filha pequenina de quem o esbofeteara, dando esmola a quem ele já sabia que o havia de trair. Instintivamente reconstruía em si a história de Cristo para sua, e, olhando em si finalmente o seu longo martírio, mais longo, mais humilhante e mais doloroso do que o do Nazareno, rompia em lágrimas ardentes e consoladoras de piedade por si mesmo futuro, de longo e abrasado amor pela humanidade inteira... Deitava-se enfim, sentindo-se consolado e triste das lágrimas que chorara, a testa ardendo, os olhos em fogo, as faces contraídas mecanicamente para chorar mais, quase chorando alto em fim, feliz e triste do doloroso amor ardendo no seu coração.\\n\",\n",

       "  'text': '\\nL. do D.\\n\\nHá sensações que são sonos, que ocupam como uma névoa toda a extensão do espírito, que não deixam pensar que não deixam agir, que não deixam claramente ser. Como se não tivessemos dormido, sobrevive em nós qualquer coisa de sonho, e há um torpor do sol do dia a aquecer a superfície estagnada dos sentidos. É uma bebedeira de não ser nada, e a vontade é um balde despejado para o quintal por um movimento indolente do pé à passagem.\\n\\nOlha-se mas não se vê. A longa rua movimentada de humanos é uma espécie de tabuleta deitada onde as letras fossem móveis e não formassem sentidos. As casas são somente casas. Perde-se a possibilidade de dar um sentido ao que se vê, mas vê-se bem o que é, sim.\\n\\nAs pancadas de martelo à porta do caixoteiro soam com uma estranheza próxima Soam grandemente separadas, cada uma com eco e sem proveito. Os ruídos das carroças parecem de dia em que vem trovoada. As vozes saem do ar, e não de gargantas. Ao fundo, o rio está cansado.\\n\\nNão é tédio o que se sente. Não é mágoa o que se sente. É uma vontade de dormir com outra personalidade, e esquecer com melhoria de vencimento. Não se sente nada, a não ser um automatismo cá em baixo, a fazer umas pernas que nos pertencem levar a bater no chão, na marcha involuntária, uns pés que se sentem dentro dos sapatos. Nem isto se sente talvez. À roda dos olhos e como dedos nos ouvidos há um aperto de dentro da cabeça.\\n\\nParece uma constipação na alma. E com a imagem literária de se estar doente nasce um desejo de que a vida fosse uma convalescença, sem andar; e a ideia de convalescença evoca as quintas dos arredores, mas lá para dentro, onde são lares, longe da rua e das rodas. Sim, não se sente nada. Passa-se conscientemente, a dormir só com a impossibilidade de dar ao corpo outra direcção, a porta onde se deve entrar. Passa-se tudo. Que é do pandeiro, ó urso parado?\\n\\nLeve, como uma coisa que começasse, a maresia da brisa pairou de sobre o Tejo e espalhou-se sujamente pelos princípios da Baixa. Nauseava frescamente, num torpor frio de mar morno. Senti a vida no estômago, e o olfacto tornou-se-me uma coisa por detrás dos olhos. Altas, pousavam em nada nuvens ralas, rolos, num cinzento a desmoronar-se para branco falso. A atmosfera era de uma ameaça de céu cobarde, como a de uma trovoada inaudível, feita de ar somente.\\n\\nHavia estagnação no próprio voo das gaivotas; pareciam coisas mais leves que o ar, deixadas nele por alguém. Nada abafava. A tarde caía num desassossego nosso; o ar refrescava intermitentemente.\\n\\nPobres das esperanças que tenho tido, saídas da vida que tenho tido de ter! São como esta hora e este ar, névoas sem névoa, alinhavos rotos de tormenta falsa. Tenho vontade de gritar, para acabar com a paisagem e a meditação. Mas há maresia no meu propósito, e a baixa-mar em mim deixou descoberto o negrume lodoso que está ali fora e não vejo senão pelo cheiro.\\n\\nTanta inconsequência em querer bastar-me! Tanta consciência sarcástica das sensações supostas! Tanto enredo da alma com as sensações, dos pensamentos com.o ar e o rio, para dizer que me dói a vida no olfacto e na consciência, para não saber dizer, como na frase simples e ampla do Livro de Job «Minha alma está cansada de minha vida!»\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nL. do D.\\n\\nMeditei hoje, num intervalo de sentir, na forma de prosa de que uso. Em verdade, como escrevo? Tive, como muitos têm tido, a vontade pervertida de querer ter um sistema e uma norma. É certo que escrevi antes da norma e do sistema; nisso, porém, não sou diferente dos outros.\\n\\nAnalisando-me à tarde, descubro que o meu sistema de estilo assenta em dois princípios, e imediatamente, e à boa maneira dos bons clássicos, erijo esses dois princípios em fundamentos gerais de todo estilo: dizer o que se sente exactamente como se sente — claramente, se é claro; obscuramente, se é obscuro; confusamente, se é confuso —; compreender que a gramática é um instrumento, e não uma lei.\\n\\nSuponhamos que vejo diante de nós uma rapariga de modos masculinos. Um ente humano vulgar dirá dela, «Aquela rapariga parece um rapaz». Um outro ente humano vulgar, já mais próximo da consciência de que falar é dizer, dirá dela, «Aquela rapariga é um rapaz». Outro ainda, realmente consciente dos deveres da expressão, mas mais animado do afecto pela concisão, que é a luxúria do pensamento, dirá dela, «Aquele rapaz». Eu direi, «Aquela rapaz», violando a mais elementar das regras da gramática, que manda que haja concordância de género, como de número, entre a voz substantiva e a adjectiva. E terei dito bem; terei falado em absoluto, fotograficamente, fora da chateza, da norma, e da quotidianidade. Não terei falado: terei dito.\\n\\nA gramática, definindo o uso, faz divisões legítimas e falsas. Divide, por exemplo, os verbos em transitivos e intransitivos; porém, o homem de saber dizer tem muitas vezes que converter um verbo transitivo em intransitivo para fotografar o que sente, e não para, como o comum dos animais homens, o ver às escuras. Se quiser dizer que existo, direi «Sou». Se quiser dizer que existo como alma separada, direi «Sou eu». Mas se quiser dizer que existo como entidade que a si mesma se dirige e forma, que exerce junto de si mesma a função divina de se criar, como hei-de empregar o verbo «ser» senão convertendo-o subitamente em transitivo? E então, triunfalmente, antigramaticalmente supremo, direi «Sou-me». Terei dito uma filosofia em duas palavras pequenas. Que preferível não é isto a não dizer nada em quarenta frases? Que mais se pode exigir da filosofia e da dicção?\\n\\nObedeça à gramática quem não sabe pensar o que sente. Sirva-se dela quem sabe mandar nas suas expressões. Conta-se de Sigismundo, Rei de Roma, que tendo, num discurso público, cometido um erro de gramática, respondeu a quem dele lhe falou, «Sou Rei de Roma, e acima da gramática». E a história narra que ficou sendo conhecido nela como Sigismundo «super-grammaticam». Maravilhoso símbolo! Cada homem que sabe dizer o que diz é, em seu modo, Rei de Roma. O título não é mau, e a alma é ser-se.\\n',\n",

À roda da estátua central as pombas são migalhas pretas que se mexem, como se lhes desse um vento espalhador. Dão passinhos, gordas sobre pés pequenos.\\nE são sombras, sombras...\\n\\nVista de perto, toda a gente é monotonamente diversa. Dizia Vieira que Frei Luís de Sousa escrevia «o comum com singularidade». Esta gente é singular com comunidade, às avessas d0 estilo da Vida do Arcebispo. Tudo isto me faz pena, sendo-me todavia indiferente. Vim parar aqui sem razão, como tudo na vida.\\nDo lado do oriente, entrevista, a cidade ergue-se quase a prumo falso, assalta estaticamente o Castelo. O sol pálido molha de um aureolar vago essa mole súbita de casas que para aqui o oculta. O céu é de um azul humidamente esbranquiçado. A chuva de ontem talvez se repita hoje, mas mais branda. O vento parece leste, talvez porque aqui mesmo, de repente, cheira vagamente ao maduro e verde do mercado próximo. Do lado oriental da Praça há mais forasteiros que do outro. Como descargas alcatifadas, as portas onduladas descem para cima; não sei porquê, é assim a frase que me transmite aquele som. É talvez porque fazem mais esse som ao descer, porém agora sobem. Tudo se explica.\\nDe repente estou só no mundo. Vejo tudo isto do alto de um telhado espiritual. Estou só no mundo. Ver é estar distante. Ver claro é parar Analisar é ser estrangeiro. Toda a gente passa sem roçar por mim. Tenho só ar à minha volta. Sinto-me tão isolado que sinto a distância entre mim e o meu fato. Sou uma criança, com uma palmatória mal acesa, que atravessa, de camisa de noite, uma grande casa deserta. Vivem sombras que me cercam — só sombras, filhas dos móveis hirtos e da luz que me acompanha. Elas me rondam aqui ao sol, mas são gente.\\n',\n",

Não consegui nunca ver-me de fora. Não há espelho que nos dê a nós como foras, porque não há espelho que nos tire de nós mesmos. Era precisa outra alma, outra colocação do olhar e do pensar. Se eu fosse actor prolongado de cinema, ou gravasse em discos audíveis a minha voz alta, estou certo que do mesmo modo ficaria longe de saber o que sou do lado de lá, pois, queira o que queira, grave-se o que de mim se grave, estou sempre aqui dentro, na quinta de muros altos da minha consciência de mim.\\n\\nNão sei se os outros serão assim, se a ciência da vida não consistirá essencialmente em ser tão alheio a si mesmo que instintivamente se consegue um alheamento e se pode participar da vida como estranho à consciência; ou se os outros, mais ensimesmados do que eu, não serão de todo a bruteza de não serem senão eles, vivendo exteriormente por aquele milagre pelo qual as abelhas formam sociedades mais organizadas que qualquer nação, e as formigas comunicam entre si com uma fala de antenas mínimas que excede nos resultados a nossa complexa ausência de nos entendermos.\\n\\nA geografia da consciência da realidade é de uma grande complexidade de costas, acidentadíssima de montanhas e de lagos. E tudo me parece, se medito de mais, uma espécie de mapa como o do Pays du Tendre ou das Viagens de Gulliver, brincadeira da exactidão inscrita num livro irónico ou fantasista para gáudio de entes superiores, que sabem onde é que as terras são terras.\\n\\nTudo é complexo para quem pensa, e sem dúvida o pensamento o torna mais complexo por volúpia própria. Mas quem pensa tem a necessidade de justificar a sua abdicação com um vasto programa de compreender, exposto, como as razões dos que mentem, com todos os pormenores excessivos que descobrem, com o espalhar da terra, a raiz da mentira.\\n\\nTudo é complexo, ou sou eu que o sou. Mas, de qualquer modo, não importa porque, de qualquer modo, nada importa. Tudo isto, tocas estas considerações extraviadas da rua larga, vegeta nos quintais dos deuses exclusos como trepadeiras longe das paredes. E sorrio, na noite em que concluo sem fim estas considerações sem engrenagem da ironia vital que as faz surgir de uma alma humana, arfa, de antes dos astros, das grandes razões do Destino.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\n«Programa do periódico de Caeiro, R. Reis, etc.»\\n\\nMelhor do que enfastiar no início, por uma exposição argumentada, ao comunicar ao nosso público, seja ele qual tenha de ser, e de quantos possa vir a ser, será, em breves palavras, classificativamente, enfeixar em formulas dogmáticas qual seja o resumo (súmula) da nossa atitude. No desdobrar das publicações aqui a inserir virão, cada uma em sua necessária altura, as provas das asserções que este programa postula, e o estabelecimento definido das bases em que esses mesmos postulados assentam. Por ora, para fins de gravar na mente dos possíveis curiosos deste periódico, limitamos a nossa apresentação a essa sucinta (...) das bases sobre que assenta a nossa attitude.\\nAs cláusulas seguintes encerram-a completamente:\\n1. A civilização moderna, assente sobre bases de psiquismo cristão, é desde seu início uma decadência; em lugar de se continuar a obra da Grécia, enxertou-se sobre o espírito grego decadente o espírito romano decadente e o espírito semita decadente. A nossa civilização é o produto de três decadências somadas. O que tem de bom provém da neutralização que esses três géneros de decadência por vezes, e em certos pontos, realizam um sobre os outros. Todo o caminho andado, o que verdadeiramente tem constituído progresso, tem sido contrário ao próprio íntimo espírito da nossa civilização.\\n2. Importa, portanto, acima de tudo, procurar reatar a tradição perdida da obra grega, afastando o elemento romano e o elemento semita, que representam atrasos e degenerescências em referência ao psiquismo grego, formas inferiores de civilização que supuraram ao contacto com a Grécia e a continuaram depois...\\n3. Para isso importa, antes de mais nada, atacar de frente o espírito filosófico que data, na sua forma mais doente, de Kant, e que pretende centralizar no homem e na consciência individual a realidade do Universo; importa, isto é, reconstruir o materialismo grego (não no sentido de o aceitar tal qual ele era - isso não constituiria progresso) mas de o fazer evoluir.\\n4. Importa, depois, fazer guerra directa a quantas formas literárias pertencem ao misticismo cristão, varrendo de diante do caminho das nossas ideias os obstáculos que lhe ergue a convicção da importância da chamada Vida Interior. Reintegrar o homem na Natureza sem o tirar da humanidade.\\n5. Desfazer o erro enorme que existe em toda a gente moderna de que o ideal grego é sensual ou propriamente animal. O ideal grego é essencialmente de calma e de domínio de si-próprio; só tomou aspecto de sensualidade e de fúria da beleza através dos cérebros grosseiros dos romanos e, depois, coado pela mentalidade confusa dos semitas de várias espécies. O ideal grego é de castidade dentro da normalidade; de equilíbrio dentro da realização dos desejos e dos instintos. No seu grau mais nítido, é representado pelo ideal estóico, essencialmente intelectual, essencialmente triste. O grego era essencialmente triste, como todos os grandes equilibrados, em quem é elemento psíquico basilar a consciência da impermanência, da fatalidade e da futilidade das coisas, sem que haja do indivíduo para si-próprio licença para sonhar além-mundos ou paraísos que nenhum facto natural justifica ou aponta. Platão é a decadência do ideal grego.\\n6. Combater, dentro dos débeis limites que a inteligência pode ter na sua acção, as ideias imperialistas, colectivistas, humanitárias, (...). As pequenas nações são as únicas que têm direito a existir, porque o único agregado humano civilizado é a Cidade, e o único agregado humano natural é a região. - O indivíduo é a única realidade natural, é através dele e para proveito dele que a sociedade existe; por isso deve ser combatido tudo quanto (...)\\n7. Qualquer que seja a atitude própria a tomar num período de civilização verdadeira, no período actual a atitude tem de ser adaptada a ele; tem de ser uma atitude de calmo afastamento, de reconstrução por cada individualidade de si-própria de acordo consigo e com as grandes realidades fundamentais do Universo. - Não fazer propaganda ostensiva nenhuma; expor ideias sem querer convencer, deixando que quem quiser a si se convença; não se preocupar com os problemas modernos de espécie nenhuma, nem nacionais, nem económicos, nem estéticos mesmo ou intelectuais. Por enquanto, todo o nosso esforço deve ser criar para nós a nossa atitude, procurar reencontrar a Grécia dentro de nós, formar uma concepção do Universo e das Coisas que seja a necessária e procurada continuação da concepção grega. Se esta atitude tiver de alastrar, ela alastrará por si, sem que tenhamos que chamar a atenção gritando. Todo o entusiasmo é um desequilíbrio. É de mau gosto ser enérgico e intenso. Tudo pertence ao Destino, deus dos deuses.\\n8. Presentemente, temos que ser estóicos, como foram os últimos representantes do paganismo no meio da febre e da lama do império romano, do lodo do cristianismo nascente, das invasões espirituais semíticas; o nosso caminho é ao contrário do deles. Eles vieram do paganismo natural para o estoicismo, porque o paganismo em face à civilização do império decadente (às civilizações decadentes) tem de ser o estoicismo. Nós iremos buscar o estoicismo para reatar o fio e ver se conseguimos subir outra vez, mas a nosso modo, às fontes e às origens do espírito pagão. Os estóicos ficaram sem sequentes; seremos nós os sequentes deles.\\n9. Tudo isto não teria sentido se fosse uma atitude decidida intelectualmente, isto é, concebida como uma filosofia de acção. Os autores que se reúnem para formar este periódico são todos temperamentalmente assim, não intelectualmente. O facto de aparecer num país pequeno mais do que um temperamento deste genero é, já de si, indicador de qualquer coisa. Não é pagão quem quer, mas quem pagão nasce. Não compreende o paganismo quem quer, mas sim apenas quem o sente nas veias. Há muito quem ame o paganismo, mas é um paganismo à romana, que não é senão a degenerescência e a doença do outro, porque, propriamente, nem à romana sói ser, mas antes à romana da decadência, ou à moderna, concebendo Grécia através de Roma, e essa Roma através da Judeia que está no nosso sangue. Somos uma mistura de decadências.\\n10. O facto de que em Portugal aparecem estes temperamentos parece indicar que tem o nosso país que tomar sobre si a vanguarda - talvez inútil - do movimento neopagão. Uma escola dizendo-se neoclássica apareceu em França, mas está tão longe como os outros de sentir a sobriedade do ideal grego; e aliás, é monárquica, imperialista e católica, o que nenhum grego por temperamento pagão pode ser. É uma tentativa de sentir a Grécia, mas é sempre através de Roma, e Roma decadente, que a Grécia é sentida.\\n11. Nada nos daria maior prazer do que receber qualquer sinal de acordo connosco da parte de quaisquer portugueses que julguem da hora a nossa obra. Mas não convidamos ninguém a procurar-nos. A nossa obra exige que cada um se isole, para ver se se encontra. Todos os esforços são poucos, dada a confusão que nos cerca em tudo, para nos encontrarmos equilibradamente, e não irmos despenhados, como cristãos doentes, pelos nossos sonhos abaixo, nem cairmos na acção, porque isso é próprio de quem não tem nada que fazer. Não falamos com pessoa nenhuma, nem nos dispomos a fazer propaganda da nossa atitude, excepto a inevitável que o nosso periódico faça. Aceitamos de bom grado toda a controvérsia, mas não publicaremos aqui artigos de adversários. A nossa obra é nossa. Responderemos contudo sempre, porque sabemos onde estamos e para onde é o nosso caminho.\\n12. A calma, a paz e o domínio de si-próprio são o nosso objectivo e o que propomos a cada qual que queira estar connosco; o afastamento da sensualidade, da religiosidade interior, dos instintos humanitários, do sonho e da (...). só numa reconstituição do paganismo dos helenos se pode encontrar o bálsamo para a febre das nossas almas. Procuremos ver as coisas claramente, não pondo ideais nossos adiante dos olhos, graves e tristes como convém a homens conscientes da fatalidade das coisas e da nossa transitória pequenez dentro deste grande e sereno Universo.\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nPara que nada fique por explicar, e como as origens são tudo, pode interessar a alguns leitores saber como nasceu este movimento, que assim tão inesperadamente lhe aparece.\\nHá quatro anos encontravam-se em Lisboa os três colaboradores desta revista e um outro indivíduo ainda, poeta, hoje desviado infelizmente para atitudes febris místicas, e ébrias de desequilíbrio; não importa, porém - esses quatro encontravam-se em Lisboa há quatro anos. Em todos nós havia uma ânsia - febril ainda - de encontrar aquilo que em nós comummente havia, que não divisávamos o que fosse, mas que era palpavelmente inimigo de tudo quanto nos cercava, desde a arte até à vida. Talvez o convívio despertasse finalmente no maior de todos quatro, enfim, o sentido da nova orientação a dar ao conceito do Universo. Um ano depois Alberto Caeiro leu-nos a série de poemas que vêm publicados adiante, e que formam o grande primeiro passo para o nosso fim. Essa obra que singelamente segue é um marco miliário - ver-se-á depois - do pensamento humano. Pasma-se de que hoje, entre esta gente que nos cerca, fosse possível ir assim reatar o fio da tradição grega perdida. Alberto Caeiro é o maior de todos os poetas contemporâneos, dizemos só isto, porque seria talvez excessivo, posto que verdadeiro, dizer mais. O Guardador de Rebanhos foi para todos nós qualquer coisa como para um geógrafo sonhador da Renascença deveria ser a descoberta da América, se ele pudesse bem medir o que de ali resultaria. Nós medimos bem, e logo, o que era a obra que Ele nos lera. Ele conseguira livrar-se de tudo quanto constitui a alma que o cristianismo nos fez, regressou a um cristianismo primitivo, mais pagão do que outra coisa, e, assim, encontrou outra vez a Natureza, há dois mil anos perdida da inteligência dos homens. Com o Guardador de Rebanhos, o espírito humano fez a coisa mais importante que há dois mil anos tem feito, regressou ao seu Lar, de um golpe eliminou todas as camadas de degenerescência que Roma e a Judeia nos puseram. Há ainda filamentos de sentimentalidade cristã nessa obra; mas o essencial era descobrir o sentimento naturalista, e isso ficou feito, de uma vez para sempre. O naturalismo apareceu sob uma forma renovada e original. Doravante todas as dificuldades eram secundárias. O corpo do nosso intuito tinha já alma.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'By defining a thing I understand expressing it in the terms...\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nBy defining a thing I understand expressing it in the terms of other things already known, of course. By positive definition I understand one in which we assert that which the defined is and not merely what it is not, as happens with infinity. A complete definition I take to be one in which are included all the attributes of the thing defined. Thus to say of a man that he is a thing that moves is well but insufficient; it is a positive definition, yet lacks the character of completeness.\\nPlato has noticed three kinds of definition: definition by enumeration of parts, definition by (...), and the definition by the difference, the difference, that is, in regard to other things.\\nThe last kind needs to be well considered. Its basis seems correct and true — to define a thing by what is proper to it, by separating it distinctly from other things.\\nTrue definition should, by saying what a thing is, at the same time to say what it is not.\\nDefinition is based, of course, on things which are known. Thus if an Englishman were to ask me what was the metre I might answer «39 odd inches» and he would understand me well, for he knows quite well what is an inch.\\nObviously in going back in the line of definition I shall reach things which I cannot define (if I reach anything). Now these are either unknown or they are known things, yet which are known by intuition, [...] by definition. After almost endless worry we are brought, for instance, to the notion of colour, or to the notion of weight and we are called to define it.\\n\\n1. We know a thing only by definition; i.e. definition (positive and complete) is the proof of our knowledge.\\n2. We go on from definition to definition. Either we have to stop or we have not to stop. If we have to stop we do or either by moving in a circle, or by stopping somewhere in a straight line.\\n\\nConsider the bearing of these things upon our knowledge. If we move in a circle, obviously we do not know the thing defined, for we make the knowledge thereof rest upon itself. If our motion is towards the infinite, and itself, therefore, indefinite, we do not know any more, and knowledge is impossible.\\nIf we, in defining, passing from definition to definition, have to stop somewhere and can go no further, we have arrived at some primary notion which either marks our complete ignorance or has to be conceived as known by intuition. Thus, if, in defining a triangle, we were ultimately arrested, brought up, at the notions of number (from 3 sides) and of form, what have we to say of human knowledge? Are we to accept the conclusion of the sceptics? Or must we ultimately be dogmatic in our theory of knowledge? We shall endeavour, by close examination of the problem, to arrive at some conclusion with regard to this, the primary question in philosophy.\\nIt is best to begin by an example: «give the definition of a piano». We take it from a dictionary: «a musical instrument, consisting of a series of wires of graduated length, thickness and tension, struck by hammers moved by keys». The first thing to be done is to reduce this to a more logical form through less elegant and of less practical use. «A piano is an instrument (I) for the production of music (2) and which consists of wires struck by hammers which are moved by keys (3).»\\nThis definition consists of (1) (...), the end and at the same time the species (2), the contents or (...)\\n\\nLet us plunge deeper into this. «An instrument (1) is that by means of which anything is effected.» And what is a mean? «Intermediate agency» is the answer; more logically it is «the material relation between Cause and end». Here are we brought to the ideas of relation, of cause, of end. What is relation, what is cause, what is end? Relation cannot be well defined; it is primary and primitive in the human mind. Yet there is a definition of it, which I have made for the moment: «Relation is that which a (any) number of things being given, is contained to (the) perception, in their plurality.» (Plurality creates relation).\\n',\n",

A sensibilidade — tomada aqui no mais amplo dos seus sentidos possíveis — é a fonte de toda a criação civilizada. Mas essa criação só pode dar-se completamente quando essa sensibilidade esteja adaptada ao meio em que funciona; na proporção da adaptação da sensibilidade ao meio está a grandeza e a força da obra resultante.\\nOra a sensibilidade, embora varie um pouco pela influência insistente do meio actual, é, nas suas linhas gerais, constante, e determinada no mesmo indivíduo desde a sua nascença, função do temperamento que a hereditariedade lhe infixou. A sensibilidade, portanto, progride por gerações.\\nAs criações da civilização, que constituem o «meio» da sensibilidade, são a cultura, o progresso científico, a alteração nas condições políticas (dando à expressão um sentido completo); ora estes ó e sobretudo o progresso cultural e científico, uma vez começado — progridem não por obra de gerações, mas pela interacção e sobreposição da obra de indivíduos, e, embora lentamente a princípio, breve progridem ao ponto de tomarem proporções em que, de geração a geração, centenas de alterações se dão nestes novos estímulos da sensibilidade, ao passo que a sensibilidade deu; ao mesmo tempo, só um avanço, que é o de uma geração, porque o pai não transmite ao filho senão uma pequena parte das qualidades adquiridas.\\nTemos, pois, que a uma certa altura da civilização há de haver uma desadaptação da sensibilidade ao meio, que consiste dos seus estímulos — uma falência portanto. Dá-se isso na nossa época, cuja incapacidade de criar grandes valores deriva dessa desadaptação.\\nA desadaptação não foi grande no primeiro período da nossa civilização, da Renascença ao século XVIII, em que os estímulos da sensibilidade eram sobretudo de ordem cultural, porque esses estímulos, por sua própria natureza, eram de progresso lento, e atingiam a princípio apenas as camadas superiores da sociedade.\\nAcentuou-se a desadaptação no segundo período, que parte da Revolução para o século XIX, e em que os estímulos são já sobretudo políticos, onde a progressão é facilmente maior e o alcance do estímulo muito mais vasto. Cresceu a desadaptação vertiginosamente no período desde meados do século XIX à nossa época, em que o estímulo, sendo as criações da ciência, produz já uma rapidez de desenvolvimento que deixa atrás os progressos da sensibilidade, e, nas aplicações práticas da ciência, atinge toda a sociedade. Assim se chega à enorme desproporção entre o termo presente da progressão geométrica dos estímulos da sensibilidade e o termo correspondente da progressão aritmética da própria sensibilidade.\\nDaí a desadaptação, a incapacidade criativa da nossa época. Temos, portanto, um dilema: ou morte da civilização, ou adaptação artificial, visto que a natural, a instinctiva faliu.\\nPara que a civilização não morra, proclamo, portanto em segundo lugar,\\n\\nA Necessidade da Adaptação Artificial\\n\\nO que é a adaptação artificial?\\nÉ um acto de cirurgia sociológica. É a transformação violenta da sensibilidade de modo a tornar-se apta a acompanhar pelo menos por algum tempo, a progressão dos seus estímulos.\\nA sensibilidade chegou a um estado mórbido, porque se desadaptou. Não há que pensar em curá-la. Não há curas sociais. Há que pensar em operá-la para que ela possa continuar a viver. Isto é, temos que substituir a morbidez natural da desadaptação pela sanidade artificial feita pela intervenção cirúrgica, embora envolva uma mutilação.\\nO que é que é preciso eliminar do psiquismo contemporâneo?\\nEvidentemente que é aquilo que seja a aquisição fixa mais recente no espírito — isto é, aquela aquisição geral do espírito humano civilizado que seja anterior ao estabelecimento da nossa civilização, mas recentemente anterior; e isto por três razões: (a) porque, por ser a mais recente das fixações psíquicas, é a menos difícil de eliminar; (b) porque, visto que cada civilização se forma por uma reacção contra a anterior, são os princípios da anterior que são os mais antagónicos à actual e que mais impedem a sua adaptação às condições especiais que durante esta apareçam; (c) porque, sendo a aquisição fixa mais recente, a sua eliminação não ferirá tão fundo a sensibilidade geral como o faria a eliminação, ou a pretensão de eliminar, qualquer fundo depósito psíquico.\\nQual é a ultima aquisição fixa do espírito humano geral?\\nDeve ser composta de dogmas do cristianismo, porque a Idade Média, vigência plena daquele sistema religioso, precede imediatamente e duradouramente, a eclosão da nossa civilização, e os princípios cristãos são contraditados pelos firmes ensinamentos da ciência moderna.\\nA adaptação artificial será portanto espontanente feita desde que se faça uma eliminação das aquisições fixas do espírito humano, que derivam da sua mergência no cristianismo.\\nProclamo, por isso, em terceiro lugar, \\n\\nA intervenção cirúrgica anti-cristã\\n\\nResolve-se ela, como é de ver, na eliminação dos três preconceitos, dogmas, ou atitudes, que o cristianismo fez que se infiltrassem na própria substância da psique humana.\\nExplicação concreta:\\n\\n1. — Abolição do dogma da personalidade — isto é, de que temos uma Personalidade «separada» das dos outros. É uma ficção teológica. A personalidade de cada um de nós é composta (como o sabe a psicologia moderna, sobretudo desde a maior atenção dada à sociologia) do cruzamento social com as «personalidades» dos outros, da imersão em correntes e direcções sociais e da fixação de vincos hereditários, oriundos, em grande parte, de fenómenos de ordem colectiva. Isto é, no presente, no futuro, e no passado, somos parte dos outros, e eles parte de nós. Para o auto-sentimento cristão, o homem mais perfeito é o que com mais verdade possa dizer «eu sou eu»; para a ciência, o homem mais perfeito é o que com mais justiça possa dizer «eu sou todos os outros».\\nDevemos pois operar a alma, de modo a abri-la à consciência da sua interpenetração com as almas alheias obtendo assim uma aproximação concretizada do Homem-Completo, do Homem-Síntese da Humanidade.\\nResultados desta operacão:\\n\\n(a) Em política: Abolição total do conceito de democracia, conforme a Revolução Francesa, pelo qual dois homens correm mais que um homem só, o que é falso, porque um homem que vale por dois é que corre mais que um homem só! Um mais um não são mais do que um, enquanto um e um não formam aquele Um a que se chama Dois. — Substituição, portanto, à Democracia, da Ditadura do Completo, do Homem que seja, em si-próprio, o maior número de Outros; que seja, portanto, A Maioria. Encontra-se assim o Grande Sentido da Democracia, contrário em absoluto ao da actual, que, aliás, nunca existiu.\\n(b) Em arte: Abolição total do conceito de que cada indivíduo tem o direito ou o dever de exprimir o que sente. Só tem o direito ou o dever de exprimir o que sente, em arte, o indivíduo que sente por vários. Não confundir com «a expressão da Época», que é buscada pelos indivíduos que nem sabem\\nsentir por si-próprios. O que é preciso é o artista que sinta por um certo número de Outros, todos diferentes uns dos outros, uns do passado, outros do presente, outros do futuro. O artista cuja arte seja uma Síntese-Soma, e não uma Síntese-Subtracção dos outros de si, como a arte dos actuais.\\n(c) Em filosofia: Abolição do conceito de verdade absoluta. Criação da Super-Filosofia. O filósofo passará a ser o interpretador de subjectividades entrecruzadas, sendo o maior filósofo o que maior número de filosofias espontâneas alheias concentrar. Como tudo é subjectivo, cada opinião é verdadeira para cada homem: a maior verdade será a soma-síntese-interior do maior número destas opiniões verdadeiras que se contradizem umas às outras.\\n\\n2. — Abolição do preconceito da individualidade. — É outra ficção teológica — a de que a alma de cada um é una e indivisível. A ciência ensina, ao contrário, que cada um de nós é um agrupamento de psiquismos subsidiários, uma síntese malfeita de almas celulares. Para o auto-sentimento cristão, o homem mais perfeito é o mais coerente consigo próprio; para o homem de ciência, o mais perfeito é o mais incoerente consigo próprio,\\nResultados:\\n\\n(a) Em política: A abolição de toda a convicção que dure mais que um estado de espírito, o desaparecimento total de toda a fixidez de opiniões e de modos-de-ver; desaparecimento portanto de todas as instituições que se apoiem no facto de qualquer «opinião pública» poder durar mais de meia-hora. A solução de um problema num dado momento histórico será feita pela coordenação ditatorial (vide parágrafo anterior) dos impulsos do momento dos componentes humanos desse problema, que é uma coisa puramente subjectiva, é claro. Abolição total do passado e do futuro como elementos com que se conte, ou em que se pense, nas soluções políticas. Quebra inteira de todas as continuidades.\\n(b) Em arte: Abolição do dogma da individualidade artística. O maior artista será o que menos se definir, e o que escrever em mais géneros com mais contradições e dissemelhanças. Nenhum artista deverá ter só uma personalidade. Deverá ter várias, organizando cada uma por reunião concretizada de estados de alma semelhantes, dissipando assim a ficção grosseira de que é uno e indivisível.\\n(c) Em filosofia: Abolição total da Verdade como conceito filosófico, mesmo relativo ou subjectivo. Redução da filosofia à arte de ter teorias interessantes sobre o «Universo». O maior filósofo aquele artista do pensamento, ou antes da «arte abstracta» (nome futuro da filosofia) que mais teorias coordenadas, não relacionadas entre si, tiver sobre a «Existência».\\n\\n3. — Abolição do dogma do objectivismo pessoal. — A objectividade é uma média grosseira entre as subjectividades parciais. Se uma sociedade for composta, por ex., de cinco homens, a, b, c, d, e e, a «verdade» ou «objectividade» para essa sociedade será representada por \\n\\n\\na+b+c+d+e\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo futuro cada indivíduo deve tender para realizar em si esta média. Tendência, portanto de cada indivíduo, ou, pelo menos, de cada indivíduo superior, a ser uma harmonia entre as subjectividades alheias (das quais a própria faz parte), para assim se aproximar o mais possível daquela Verdade-Infinito, para a qual idealmente tende a série numérica das verdades parciais.\\nResultado:\\n\\n(a) Em política: O domínio apenas do indivíduo ou dos indivíduos que sejam os mais hábeis Realizadores de Médias, desaparecendo por completo o conceito de que a qualquer indivíduo é lícito ter opiniões sobre política (como sobre qualquer outra coisa), pois que só pode ter opiniões o que for Média.\\n(b) Em arte: Abolição do conceito de Expressão, sustituído pelo de Entre-Expressão. Só o que tiver a consciência plena de estar exprimindo as opiniões de pessoa nenhuma (o que for Média portanto) pode ter alcance.\\n(c) Em filosofia: Substituição do conceito de Filosofia pelo de Ciência, visto a Ciência ser a Média concreta entre as opiniões filosóficas, verificando-se ser média pelo seu «carácter objectivo», isto é, pela sua adaptação ao «universo exterior» que é a Média das subjectividades. Desaparecimento portanto da Filosofia em proveito da Ciência.\\nResultados finais, sintéticos:\\n\\n(a) Em política: Monarquia Científica, antitradicionalista e anti-hereditária, absolutamente espontânea pelo aparecimento sempre imprevisto do Rei-Média. Relegação do Povo ao seu papel cientificamente natural de mero fixador dos impulsos de momento.\\n(b) Em arte: Substituição da expressão de uma época por trinta ou quarenta poetas, pela sua expressão por (por ex.), dois poetas cada um com quinze ou vinte personalidades, cada uma das quais seja uma Média entre correntes sociais do momento.\\n(c) Em filosofia: Integração da filosofia na arte e na ciência; desaparecimento, portanto, da filosofia como metafísica-ciência. Desaparecimento de todas as formas do sentimento religioso (desde o cristianismo ao humanitarismo revolucion´srio) por não representarem uma Média.\\n\\nMas qual o Método, o feitio da operação colectiva que há de organizar, nos homens do futuro, esses resultados? Qual o Método operatório inicial?\\nO Método sabe-o só a geração por quem grito por quem o cio da Europa se roça contra as paredes ! Se eu soubesse o Método, seria eu-próprio toda essa geração!\\nMas eu só vejo o Caminho; não sei onde ele vai ter.\\nEm todo o caso proclamo a necessidade da vinda da Humanidade dos Engenheiros!\\nFaço mais: garanto absolutamente a vinda da Humanidade dos Engenheiros!\\nProclamo, para um futuro próximo, a criação científica dos Super-homens!\\nProclamo a vinda de uma Humanidade matemática e perfeita!\\nProclamo a sua Vinda em altos gritos!\\nProclamo a sua Obra em altos gritos!\\nProclamo‑A, sem mais nada, em altos gritos!\\nE proclamo também: Primeiro:\\n\\nO Super-homem será, não o mais forte, mas o mais completo!\\n\\nE proclamo também: Segundo:\\n\\nO Super-homem será, não o mais duro, mas o mais complexo!\\n\\nE proclamo também: Terceiro:\\n\\nO Super-homem será, não o mais livre, mas o mais harmónico!\\n\\nProclamo isto bem alto e bem no auge, na barra do Tejo, de costas para a Europa, braços erguidos, fitando o Atlântico e saudando abstractamente o Infinito.\\n\",\n",

       "  'text': '\\nCom quem se pode comparar Caeiro? Com pouquíssimos poetas. Não, diga-se desde já, com Cesário Verde, a quem ele se refere como se a um antepassado literário, embora uma espécie de antepassado degenerado antecipadamente. Cesário Verde exerceu sobre Caeiro o género de influência a que se pode chamar apenas provocadora da inspiração, sem transmitir qualquer espécie de inspiração. Um exemplo familiar ao leitor será a influência bem real de Chateaubriand sobre Hugo, um homem totalmente diferente pessoal, literária e socialmente. (. . . )\\nOs pouquíssimos poetas com os quais Caeiro se pode comparar, ou por no-los fazer ou poder fazer lembrar, ou por se poder conceber que tenha sido por eles influenciado, quer o achemos seriamente quer não, são Whitman, Francis Jammes e Teixeira de Pascoaes.\\n\\nCom quem mais se parece é com Whitman. Em alguns aspectos secundários parece-se com Francis Jammes. Lembra-nos fortemente Pascoaes porque, sendo a sua atitude para com a Natureza essencialmente metafísica, naturalística e aquilo a que se pode chamar uma atitude absorta, como a de Pascoaes, no entanto Caeiro é tudo isso mas ao invés do que Pascoaes é do mesmo modo.\\n\\nCaeiro e Pascoaes\\n\\nTanto Caeiro como Pascoaes encaram a Natureza de um modo directamente metafísico e místico, ambos encaram a Natureza como o que há de importante, excluindo, ou quase excluindo, o Homem e a Civilização, e ambos, finalmente, integram tudo o que cantam nesse seu sentimento naturalista. Esta base abstracta tem de comum: mas no resto são, não diferentes, mas absolutamente opostos. Talvez Caeiro proceda de Pascoaes; mas procede por oposição, por reacção. Pascoaes virado do avesso, sem o tirar do lugar onde está, dá isto — Alberto Caeiro.\\n\\nComo Whitman, Caeiro deixa-nos perplexos. Somos arrancados à nossa atitude crítica por um fenómeno tão extraordinário. Jamais vimos algo de parecido com ele. Mesmo depois de Whitman, Caeiro é estranho, e terrivelmente, pavorosamente, novo. Mesmo na nossa época, em que julgamos que nada há que nos possa espantar ou que possa gritar-nos uma novidade, Caeiro realmente espanta e realmente respira novidade absoluta. Conseguir isto numa época como a nossa constitui a prova definida e definitiva do seu génio.\\nÉ tão novo que, por vezes, parece difícil conceber claramente toda a sua novidade. É demasiado novo, e a sua novidade excessiva perturba a nossa visão dele, assim como todas as coisas em excesso perturbam a visão — embora seja bem uma novidade ser a própria novidade a coisa excessiva e que deixa a visão perturbada. Mas é essa mesma a coisa notável. Até a novidade e a maneira de ser novo são novidades em Caeiro. Difere de todos os poetas de maneira diferente daquela em que todos os grandes poetas são diferentes de outros grandes poetas. A sua individualidade possui-a ele de maneira diferente da de todos os poetas que o precederam. Whitman é bem inferior a este respeito. Para explicar Whitman, mesmo numa base em que se lhe reconheça toda a originalidade concebível, basta-nos pensar nele como alguém que viveu [amou?] intensamente a vida, e daí brotam os seus poemas como flores de uma moita. Mas o mesmo processo já não se aplica a Caeiro. Mesmo que o encaremos como um homem que vive fora da civilização (hipótese obviamente impossível), como homem com uma visão excepcionalmente clara das coisas, isso não produz logicamente no nosso espírito um resultado que se pareça com O Guardador de Rebanhos. A própria ternura das coisas como simples coisas, que caracteriza o tipo do homem que supomos (propomos) não caracteriza Caeiro. Fala algumas vezes com ternura das coisas, mas pede-nos perdão de o fazer, explicando que se fala assim é por causa da nossa «estupidez dos sentidos», para nos fazer sentir «a existência absolutamente real» das coisas. Entregue a si próprio, não tem qualquer ternura pelas coisas, mal tem qualquer ternura, até, pelas suas sensações. Aqui tocamos a sua grande originalidade, a sua objectividade quase inconcebível. Vê as coisas apenas com os olhos, não com a mente. Quando olha para uma flor, não permite que isso provoque quaisquer pensamentos. Longe de ver sermões nas pedras, nem sequer se permite conceber uma pedra como ponto de partida para um sermão. O único sermão que uma pedra encerra é, para ele, o facto de existir. A única coisa que uma pedra lhe diz é que nada tem para lhe dizer. Pode-se conceber um estado de espírito parecido com este, mas não pode conceber-se num poeta. Esta maneira de olhar para uma pedra pode ser definida como a maneira totalmente não-poética de a olhar. O facto estupendo acerca de Caeiro é que produz poesia a partir deste sentimento, ou, antes, ausência de sentimento. Sente positivamente o que até aqui só podia ser concebido como sentimento negativo. Perguntai a vós próprios: que pensais duma pedra quando a olhais sem pensar nela? O que se resume no seguinte: que pensais duma pedra quando não pensais mesmo nela? A pergunta, é claro, é completamente absurda. A coisa estranha em tudo isto é que toda a poesia de Caeiro se baseia num sentimento que achais impossível conceber como susceptível de existir. Talvez eu tenha logrado apontar a natureza extraordinária da inspiração de Caeiro, a fenomenal novidade da sua poesia, o seu génio espantoso e sem precedente, toda a sua atitude.\\n\\xa0Diz-se que Alberto Caeiro deplorou o nome de «sensacionismo» que um discípulo seu — é certo que um discípulo um tanto estranho: o Sr. Álvaro de Campos — atribuiu à sua atitude e à atitude que criou. Se Caeiro protestou contra esta palavra por possivelmente parecer designar uma «escola», como o Futurismo, por exemplo, tinha razão, e por dois motivos. Pois a própria sugestão de escolas e movimentos literários soa mal quando aplicada a um género de poesia tão incivilizada e natural. E, além disso, embora Caeiro tenha, pelo menos, dois «discípulos», o facto é que tem exercido sobre estes uma influência igual à que qualquer poeta — Cesário Verde, talvez — exerceu sobre ele: nenhum se lhe assemelha, nem de longe, embora, na realidade, a influência de Caeiro se possa descortinar em toda a obra deles muito mais nitidamente do que a influência de Cesário Verde sobre Caeiro.\\nMas o facto é que — postas de lado estas considerações — nenhum nome poderia descrever melhor a sua atitude. A sua poesia é, de facto, a «sensacionista». A sua base é a substituição do pensamento pela sensação, não só como base da inspiração — o que é compreensível — mas como meio de expressão, se assim podemos falar. E, acrescente-se, aqueles seus dois discípulos, diferentes como são dele e um do outro — são também sensacionistas, de facto. É que o Dr. Ricardo Reis, com o seu neoclassicismo, a sua crença verdadeira e real na existência das divindades pagãs, é um sensacionista puro, embora de género diferente. A sua atitude para com a natureza é tão agressiva para com o pensamento como a de Caeiro; não imagina quaisquer significados nas coisas. Vê-as apenas, e, se parece vê-las de modo diferente do de Caeiro, é que, embora as veja tão pouco intelectualmente e tão pouco poeticamente como este último as vê à luz de um conceito religioso definido do universo — paganismo, paganismo puro, o que altera necessariamente a sua maneira muito directa de sentir. Mas é pagão porque a religião sensacionista é o paganismo. É claro que um sensacionista puro e integral como Caeiro não tem, logicamente, qualquer religião, visto a religião não se encontrar entre os dados imediatos da sensação pura e directa. Mas Ricardo Reis exprimiu com grande clareza a lógica da sua atitude como puramente sensacionista. Segundo afirma, não só nos deveríamos prostrar ante a objectividade pura das coisas (daí o seu sensacionismo propriamente dito e o seu neoclassicismo, pois foram os poetas clássicos os que menos comentaram as coisas, ou as comentaram menos directamente), mas prostrar-nos ante a objectividade igual, a realidade, a naturalidade, das necessidades da nossa natureza, entre as quais se conta o sentimento religioso. Caeiro é o sensacionista puro e absoluto que se prostra ante as sensações qua exterior e nada mais admite. Ricardo Reis é menos absoluto; prostra-se também ante os elementos primitivos da nossa própria natureza, visto para ele os nossos sentimentos primitivos serem tão reais e naturais como as flores e as árvores. Portanto, Caeiro é religioso. E, visto ser sensacionista, é pagão pela religião; o que se deve, não só à natureza da sensação que se concebera como admitindo uma religião qualquer, mas também à influência das leituras clássicas a que o seu sensacionismo o tinha impelido.\\nÁlvaro de Campos — o que é bastante curioso — encontra-se no extremo oposto, inteiramente oposto a Ricardo Reis. No entanto, não é menos discípulo de Caeiro ou menos sensacionista propriamente dito. Aceitou de Caeiro, não o essencial e o objectivo, mas o aspecto deduzível e subjectivo da sua atitude. A sensação é tudo, afirma Caeiro, e o pensamento é uma doença. Por sensação entende Caeiro a sensação das coisas tais como são, sem acrescentar quaisquer elementos do pensamento pessoal, convenção, sentimento ou qualquer outro lugar da alma. Para Campos, a sensação é tudo, sim, mas não necessariamente a sensação das coisas como são, antes das coisas conforme sentidas. De modo que vê a sensação subjectivamente e envida todos os seus esforços, uma vez que assim pensa, não para desenvolver em si a sensação das coisas como são, mas toda a casta de sensações de coisas, e até da mesma coisa. Sentir é tudo: é lógico concluir que o melhor é sentir toda a casta de coisas de todas as maneiras, ou, como diz o próprio Álvaro de Campos, «sentir tudo de todas as maneiras». Assim, aplica-se a sentir a cidade na mesma medida em que sente o campo, o normal como sente o anormal, o mal como sente o bem, o mórbido como sente o saudável. Nunca interroga, sente. É o filho indisciplinado da sensação. Caeiro tem uma disciplina: as coisas devem ser sentidas tais como são. Ricardo Reis tem outra disciplina diferente: as coisas devem ser sentidas, não só como são, mas também de modo a integrarem-se num certo ideal de medida e regra clássicas. Em Álvaro de Campos, as coisas devem ser simplesmente sentidas.\\nMas a origem comum destes três aspectos tão diferentes da mesma teoria é patente e manifesta.\\nCaeiro não tem ética a não ser a simplicidade. Ricardo Reis tem uma ética pagã, meio epicurista e meio estóica, mas uma ética muito definida, que dá à sua poesia uma elevação que o próprio Caeiro — embora, independentemente da maestria, seja dos dois o génio de maior estatura — não logra atingir. Álvaro de Campos não tem sombra de ética; é amoral, se não positivamente imoral, pois, evidentemente, segundo a sua teoria, e natural que ame as sensações fortes mais do que as fracas, e as sensações fortes são, pelo menos, todas elas egoístas e ocasionalmente as sensações da crueldade e da luxúria. Assim, Álvaro de Campos é dos três o que mais se parece com Whitman, mas nada tem da camaradagem deste: anda sempre afastado da multidão, e, quando sente com ela, fá-lo muito nítida, muito confessadamente para agradar a si próprio e se proporcionar sensações brutais. A ideia da perda da inocência duma criança de oito anos (Ode II, ad finem) [Ode Triunfal] é-lhe positivamente agradável, pois satisfaz duas sensações muito fortes — a crueldade e a luxúria. O mais que Caeiro diz a que talvez se possa chamar imoral é que não quer saber do sofrimento dos homens, e que a existência de doentes é interessante por ser um facto. Não há nada disto em Ricardo Reis. Vive dentro de si próprio, com a sua fé pagã e o seu epicurismo triste, mas uma das suas atitudes é precisamente não magoar ninguém. Não quer saber absolutamente nada dos outros, nem sequer o suficiente para se interessar pelo seu sofrimento ou pela sua existência. É moral por se bastar a si próprio.\\nPode-se dizer, comparando estes três poetas com as três ordens de espíritos religiosos, e comparando, de momento, o sensacionismo (embora, talvez, impropriamente) com uma religião, que Ricardo Reis é o espírito religioso normal dessa fé, Caeiro o místico puro, Álvaro de Campos o excessivamente ritualista. É que Caeiro perde de vista a Natureza na natureza, perde de vista a sensação na sensação, perde de vista as coisas nas coisas. E Campos perde de vista a sensação nas sensações.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nUltimatum, de Álvaro de Campos, foi publicado no primeiro e (pelo menos até à data) único número de Portugal Futurista, publicação literária cuja natureza vem suficientemente expressa no título, que não carece de tradução.\\nTendo escapado à censura por qualquer inexplicável golpe de sorte, esta desapareceu quando alguém chamou para Ultimatum a atenção das autoridades já depois de a revista se encontrar nos escaparates das livrarias. Portugal Futurista foi imediatamente apreendido pela Polícia e instaurado processo contra todos os escritores que colaboraram. Passou-se isto (cumpre explicar) durante o ministério democrático derrubado por Sidónio Pais na revolução de 5 de Dezembro de 1917. No entanto, é difícil imaginar como qualquer ministério, estando o país em guerra, poderia consentir na publicação de Ultimatum, que, original e magnífico como é, embora não germanófilo (pois é «anti» tudo, Aliados e alemães), contém insultos contundentes contra os Aliados, e bem assim contra Portugal e o Brasil, os próprios países aos quais, sem dúvida, «P. F.» se destinava. \\nSe traduzi Ultimatum, foi por ser bem a obra mais inteligente de literatura jamais saída da Grande Guerra. Podemos contemplar com espanto as suas teorias como indizivelmente excêntricas, podemos discordar da violência excessiva da invectiva introdutória, mas ninguém, julgo eu, pode deixar de confessar que o aspecto satírico é magnífico na sua justeza estudada de aplicação, e que o aspecto teórico, pensemos o que pensarmos acerca do valor das teorias, tem, pelo menos, os méritos raros da originalidade e da frescura.\\nSão estas boas razões para traduzir Ultimatum, e a circunstância de, embora publicado desde Setembro de 1917, só agora eu o fazer é devida ao facto, que o manuseio da obra tornará evidente, de ser impossível tal publicação durante a guerra.\\nResta dizer alguma coisa ao leitor inglês acerca da natureza da obra e acerca do autor. A tendência da obra é bem clara -- insatisfação ao ante a incapacidade construtiva característica da nossa época, em que não surgiu nenhum grande poeta, nenhum grande estadista, nem mesmo, bem vistas as coisas, nenhum grande general. Falando acerca do Ultimatum dizia-me certa vez Álvaro de Campos: «Esta guerra é a dos pigmeus mais pequenos contra os pigmeus maiores. O tempo mostrará (foi isto dito em Janeiro de 1918) quais são os maiores e quais os mais pequenos, mas, de qualquer modo, são pigmeus». «Pouco importa quem ganha a guerra, pois será ganha, de certeza, por um imbecil. Pouco importa o que dela resultará, pois o que virá será seguramente imbecilidade. Já chegou a era da engenharia física (acrescentou ele caracteristicamente), mas estamos ainda longe da era da engenharia mental. Isto mostra a medida em que recuamos da civilização grega e romana, e o crime do Cristismo representa contra a substância da cultura e do progresso». «Esse sofista reles, o PresidenteWilson», disse-me em certa ocasião, «é o tipo e o símbolo do nosso tempo. Nunca disse nada de concreto na sua vida. Seria incapaz de dizer algo de concreto para salvar aquilo que, suponho, ele julga ser a sua alma».\\nSão estas quase as palavras exactas, que, por haverem sido pronunciadas em inglês, é menos provável eu esquecer.\\nÁlvaro de Campos nasceu em Lisboa em 13 de Outubro de 1890, e viajou muito pelo Oriente e pela Europa vivendo principalmente na Escócia.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nJulho 25 - 1907. Estou cansado de confiar em mim próprio, de me lamentar a mim mesmo, de me apiedar com lágrimas, sobre o meu próprio eu. Acabo de ter uma espécie de cena com a tia Rita acerca de F. Coelho. No fim dela senti de novo um desses sintomas que cada vez se tornam mais claros e sempre mais horríveis em mim: uma vertigem moral. Na vertigem física há um rodopiar do mundo externo em relação a nós: na vertigem moral, um rodopiar do mundo interior. Parece-me perder por momentos, o sentido da verdadeira relação das coisas, perder a compreensão, cair num abismo de suspensão mental. É uma pavorosa sensação esta de uma pessoa se sentir abalada por um medo desordenado. Estes sentimentos vão-se tornando comuns, parecem abrir-me o caminho para uma nova vida mental, que acabará na loucura. Na minha família não há compreensão do meu estado mental - não, nenhuma. Riem-se de mim, escarnecem-me, não me acreditam. Dizem que o que eu pretendo é mostrar-me uma pessoa extraordinária. Nada fazem para analisar o desejo que leva uma pessoa a querer ser extraordinária. Não podem compreender que entre ser-se e desejar-se ser extraordinário não há senão a diferença da consciência que é acrescentada ao facto de se querer ser extraordinário. É o mesmo caso que se dava comigo brincando com soldados de chumbo aos sete e aos catorze anos, no primeiro caso os soldados eram para mim coisas e no segundo coisas e coisas-brinquedos ao mesmo tempo: no entanto o impulso para brincar com eles subsistia e esse é que era o real e fundamental estado psíquico.\\n\\n\\nJulho 25:\\n\\nNão tenho ninguém em quem confiar. A minha família não entende nada. Não posso incomodar os amigos com estas coisas. Não tenho realmente verdadeiros amigos íntimos, e mesmo aqueles a quem posso dar esse nome no sentido em que geralmente se emprega essa palavra, não são íntimos no sentido em que eu entendo a intimidade. Sou tímido, e tenho repugnância em dar a conhecer as minhas angústias. Um amigo íntimo é um dos meus ideais, um dos meus sonhos quotidianos, embora esteja certo de que nunca chegarei a ter um verdadeiro amigo íntimo. Nenhum temperamento se adapta ao meu. Não há um único carácter neste mundo que porventura dê mostras de se aproximar daquilo que eu suponho que deve ser um amigo íntimo. Acabemos com isto. Amantes ou namoradas é coisa que não tenho e é outro dos meus ideais, embora só encontre, por mais que procure, no íntimo desse ideal, vacuidade, e nada mais. Impossível, como eu o sonho! Ai de mim! Pobre Alastor! Oh Shelley, como eu te compreendo! Poderei eu confiar em minha mãe? Como eu desejaria tê-la junto de mim! Também não posso confiar nela. Mas a sua presença teria aliviado as minhas dores. Sinto-me abandonado como um náufrago no meio do mar. E que sou eu senão um náufrago, afinal? Por isso só em mim próprio posso confiar. Confiar em mim próprio? Que confiança poderei eu ter nestas linhas? Nenhuma. Quando volto a lê-las, o meu espírito sofre percebendo quão pretensiosas, quão a armar a um diário literário elas se apresentam! Nalgumas até mesmo cheguei a fazer estilo. A verdade, porém, é que sofro. Um homem tanto pode sofrer com um fato de seda como metido num saco ou dentro de uma manta de trapos. Nada mais.\\n',\n",

E o pior foi que o processo de imolação fosse pelo Fogo, isto é, pelo Elemento da Ordem. Assim, para falar um pouco obscuramente, o que era Adepto Exempto, em vez de passar a Mestre do Templo, foi erguido a Mago, e, apto a pronunciar a Palavra da Era, pronunciou-a como Irmão Negro, e contra a Igreja. Toda a civilização moderna, desde a Reforma aos nossos tempos, no que é oposição à Igreja e conspurcação dela e dos seus princípios, é a vingança encarnada de Jacques do Molay. A fogueira em que foi queimado o Grão-Mestre dos Templários foi o lume que ateou o incêndio em que hoje todos ardemos.\\nNum ponto, porém, a vingança de Molay, operando per vias inferiores, caiu no mesmo erro em que haviam caído os seus algozes. Foi quando D. Sebastião, AE [Adepto Exempto], foi feito cair em Alcácer Quibir. Caiu pela espada, isto é, pela Terra, e o erro foi o mesmo que o de fazer Molay cair pelo Fogo, porque de igual natureza. No mesmo modo o Adepto Exempto ascendeu a Mago, queimando o grau intermédio, e pronunciou, no tempo dado, a Palavra de Era seguinte.\\n',\n",

Expressam cinco conceitos do mundo, considerados através da emoção sexual, e são portanto «weltanschauugen» no respeitante ao instintivo.\\nO primeiro poema, Antinous, representa o conceito grego do mundo sexual. Como todos os conceitos primitivos, é substancialmente perverso; como todos os conceitos inocentes, a emoção manifestada é propositadamente não-primitiva; a fim de permitir que surja como conceito inocente, desenvolve-se o conceito até se tornar uma metafísica, mas, como se trata de inocência, a metafísica acrescenta-se a, sem se inserir dentro da substância do tema principal.\\nO segundo poema, Epithalamium, representa o conceito romano do mundo sexual. É brutal, como todas as emoções coloniais, animalesco, como todas as coisas naturais, quando são secundárias, como eram para homens tais como os romanos, que eram animais a dirigirem um estado. Neste poema não há nenhuma metafísica. Neste poema não poderia haver perversidade. O cenário, como no poema Antinous, não se relaciona com o tema. Um vulgar casamento cristão fornece o cenário; contra este pouco imaginativo cenário negro faz-se destacar o instinto romano como um monstro nu nascido do mundo.\\nO terceiro poema, Oração ao Corpo de uma Mulher, representa o conceito cristão do mundo sexual. Não tem nada a ver com o conceito cristão do mundo em si, pois, na verdade, o cristão normal não tem nada a ver com ele. A confusão do sensual e do espiritual, que os místicos cristãos aplicam aos santos do sexo oposto, (…)\\n',\n",

Sobretudo o não tem o chamado Terceiro Corpo, a obra profética mais completa (no sentido, por assim dizer, artístico ou intelectual) que se tem visto no mundo. Em vez da desordem da inteligência, que se pode dizer que distingue toda a profética, desde o Apocalipse a Nostradamo, há uma sistematização rigorosa, uma geometria do preedizer. A linguagem, certo, é simbólica, mas assim é a linguagem geral dos ensinamentos superiores, dos quais profecia é tão somente um caso particular.\\nO Apocalipse, por exemplo, é uma visão mística; o Terceiro Corpo do Bandarra é uma visão racional.\\n',\n",

Não precisa reunir, e os seus cavaleiros, para assim lhes chamar, conhecem-se sem saber uns dos outros, falam-se sem o que propriamente se chama linguagem. Quando se é escudeiro dela não se está ainda nela; quando se é mestre dela já se lhe não pertence.

Nãos se entra para ela por querer ou por ser chamado; nisto ela se conforma com a fórmula dos mestres: «Quando o discípulo está pronto, o Mestre está pronto também.» E é na palavra «pronto» que está o sentido vário, conforme as ordens e as regras.\\n\\nFiel à sua obediência — se assim se pode chamar onde não há obedecer — à Fraternidade de quem é filha e mãe, há nela a perfeita regra de Liberdade, Igualdade, Fraternidade.

Na ordem de Cristo não há juramento nem obrigação.\\n\\nEla, sendo assim tão semelhante à Fraternidade em que respira, porque, segundo a Regra, «o que está em baixo é como o que está em cima», não é contudo aquela Fraternidade: é ainda uma ordem, embora uma Ordem Fraterna, ao passo que a Fraternidade não é uma ordem.\\n',\n",

Se realidade é sinónimo de ilogismo, de que valem argumentos contra qualquer coisa?

Numa coincidência trágica, desabaram sobre mim crises de várias ordens. Estou psiquicamente cercado.\\nRenasceu a minha crise intelectual, aquela de que lhe falei mas agora renasceu mais complicada, porque, à parte ter renascido nas condições antigas, novos factores vieram emaranhá-la de todo. Estou por isso num desvairamento e numa angústia intelectuais que V. mal imagina. Não estou senhor da lucidez suficiente para lhe contar as cousas. Mas, como tenho necessidade de lhas contar, irei explicando conforme posso.\\n\\nA primeira parte da crise intelectual, já V. sabe o que é; a que apareceu agora deriva da circunstância de eu ter tomado conhecimento com as doutrinas teosóficas. O modo como as conheci foi, como V. sabe, banalíssimo. Tive de traduzir livros teosóficos. Eu nada, absolutamente nada, conhecia do assunto. Agora, como é natural, conheço a essência do sistema. Abalou-me a um ponto que eu julgaria hoje impossível, tratando-se de qualquer sistema religioso. O carácter extraordinariamente vasto desta religião-filosofia; a noção de forca, de domínio, de conhecimento superior e extra-humano que ressumam as obras teosóficas, perturbaram-me muito. Cousa idêntica me acontecera há muito tempo com a leitura de um livro inglês sobre \\n\\nOs Ritos e os Mistérios dos Rosa-Cruz. A possibilidade de que ali, na Teosofia, esteja a verdade real me «hante».\\n\\n Não me julgue V. a caminho da loucura creio que não estou. Isto é uma crise grave de um espírito felizmente capaz de ter crises desta. Ora, se V. meditar que a Teosofia é um sistema ultracristão—no sentido de conter os princípios cristãos elevados a um ponto onde se \\n\\nfundem não sei em que além-Deus \\n\\n— e pensar no que há de fundamentalmente incompatível com o meu paganismo essencial, V. terá o primeiro elemento grave que se acrescentou à minha crise. Se, depois, reparar em que a Teosofia, porque admite todas as religiões, tem um carácter inteiramente parecido com o do paganismo, que admite no seu Panteão todos os deuses, V. terá o segundo elemento da minha grave crise de alma. A Teosofia apavora-me pelo seu mistério e pela sua grandeza ocultista, repugna-me pelo seu humanitarismo \\n\\ne apostolismo\\n\\n (V. compreende?) essenciais, atrai-me por se parecer tanto com um «paganismo transcendental» (é este o nome que eu dou ao modo de pensar a que havia chegado), repugna-me por se parecer tanto com o cristianismo, que não admito. E o horror e a atracção do abismo realizados no além-alma. Um pavor metafísico, meu querido Sá-Carneiro!\\n\\nV. seguiu bem todo este labirinto intelectual? Pois bem. Repare que há outros dois elementos que ainda mais vêm complicar o assunto. Quero ver se consigo explicar-lhos lucidamente...\\n(...)\\n',\n",

When we consider them, it cannot but be astonishing that, until now, no one should have thought of writing an essay on this branch of literature or of studying its laws and its logic. But the reason is no other than that of the 2 classes of readers, (the high critical being one, and the low critical and the crowd generally the other), the first, seeing these tales mostly in the hands of mere scribblers, considers the type as of no value; and the second being pleased with them (as they are, indeed, pleased with any sort of nonsense) cares nothing for the rules, for, in its opinion, the tales are perfect.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nLisboa, 14 de Março de 1916\\n\\nMeu querido Sá-Carneiro:\\n\\nEscrevo-lhe hoje por uma necessidade sentimental — uma ânsia aflita de falar consigo. Como de aqui se depreende, eu nada tenho a dizer-lhe. Só isto — que estou hoje no fundo de uma depressão sem fundo. O absurdo da frase falará por mim.\\nEstou num daqueles dias em que nunca tive futuro. Há só um presente imóvel com um muro de angústia em torno. A margem de lá do rio nunca, enquanto é a de lá, é a de cá, e é esta a razão intima de todo o meu sofrimento. Há barcos para muitos portos, mas nenhum para a vida não doer, nem há desembarque onde se esqueça. Tudo isto aconteceu há muito tempo, mas a minha mágoa é mais antiga.\\nEm dias da alma como hoje eu sinto bem, em toda a consciência do meu corpo, que sou a criança triste em quem a vida bateu. Puseram-me a um canto de onde se ouve brincar. Sinto nas mãos o brinquedo partido que me deram por uma ironia de lata. Hoje, dia catorze de Marco, às nove horas e dez da noite, a minha vida sabe a valer isto.\\nNo jardim que entrevejo pelas janelas caladas do meu sequestro, atiraram com todos os balouços para cima dos ramos de onde pendem; estão enrolados muito alto, e assim nem a ideia de mim fugido pode, na minha imaginação, ter balouços para esquecer a hora.\\nPouco mais ou menos isto, mas sem estilo, é o meu estado de alma neste momento. Como à veladora do «Marinheiro» ardem-me os olhos, de ter pensado em chorar. Dói-me a vida aos poucos, a goles, por interstícios. Tudo isto está impresso em tipo muito pequeno num livro com a brochura a descoser-se.\\nSe eu não estivesse escrevendo a você, teria que lhe jurar que esta carta é sincera, e que as cousas de nexo histérico que aí vão saíram espontâneas do que sinto. Mas você sentirá bem que esta tragédia irrepresentável é de uma realidade de cabide ou de chávena — cheia de aqui e de agora, e passando-se na minha alma como o verde nas folhas.\\nFoi por isto que o Príncipe não reinou. Esta frase é inteiramente absurda. Mas neste momento sinto que as frases absurdas dão uma grande vontade de chorar. Pode ser que se não deitar hoje esta carta no correio amanhã, relendo-a, me demore a copiá-la à máquina, para inserir frases e esgares dela no «Livro do Desassossego». Mas isso nada roubará à sinceridade com que a escrevo, nem à dolorosa inevitabilidade com que a sinto.\\nAs últimas notícias são estas. Há também o estado de guerra com a Alemanha, mas já antes disso a dor fazia sofrer. Do outro lado da Vida, isto deve ser a legenda duma caricatura casual.\\nIsto não é bem a loucura, mas a loucura deve dar um abandono ao com que se sofre, um gozo astucioso dos solavancos da alma, não muito diferentes destes.\\nDe que cor será sentir?\\nMilhares de abraços do seu, sempre muito seu\\n\\nFernando Pessoa\\n\\nP. S. — Escrevi esta carta de um jacto. Relendo-a, vejo que, decididamente, a copiarei amanhã, antes de lha mandar. Poucas vezes tenho tão completamente escrito o meu psiquismo, com todas as suas atitudes sentimentais e intelectuais, com toda a sua histeroneurastenia fundamental, com todas aquelas intersecções e esquinas na consciência de si próprio que dele são tão características...\\nVocê acha-me razão, não é verdade?\\n',\n",

É possível que se tenha, até, ofendido um pouco comigo. Peço-lhe, por amor de Deus, que o não faça. Eu vou explicar-lhe tudo, e a explicação é bem compreensível.\\nEu tenho tido, com efeito, bastante que fazer. Tenho tido, é certo, várias pequenas causas a tomarem-me muitos pequenos bocados de tempo. Mas não é por isto que eu lhe não tenho escrito como eu próprio desejaria ter feito.\\n\\nEm primeiro lugar, tenho o espírito feito em trapos por uma série de grandes apoquentações que me atacaram, e em parte atacam, simultaneamente. Você sabe bem qual o efeito desorientador de uma acumulação de pequenas arrelias. Imagine qual será o efeito de uma acumulação de \\n\\ngrandes \\n\\napoquentações. \\n\\nUma\\n\\n grande apoquentação\\n\\n, só uma\\n\\n, não chega, muitas vezes, a valer, para o efeito de nos dispersar e banir de nós, sete ou oito ralações mínimas. Mas olhe que uma junção de arrelias grandes opera muito mais desastradamente sobre nós.\\n\\nDe há meses para cá que tenho a pesar sobre mim a gravíssima doença de minha mãe. Ela teve aquilo a que se chama vulgarmente um «nisneto apopléctico» e ficou com uma paralisia em todo o lado esquerdo do corpo. Vai melhorando — segundo as cartas que recebo — mas tão lentamente, tão incertamente, que eu nunca posso tirar do meu espírito a pressão fria da incerteza a respeito dela. Já esta angústia, hoje consubstanciada comigo, me apoquenta e me desvaira.\\nAcrescente-se-lhe o grande sofrimento que você — sem querer, é claro — me causou com a sua terrível crise. Não sei se você avalia bem até que ponto eu sou seu amigo, a que grau eu lhe sou dedicado e afeiçoado. O facto é que a sua grande crise foi uma grande crise minha, e eu sentia, como já lhe disse não só pelas suas cartas, como, já de antes, telegraficamente, pela «projecção astral» (como eles dizem) do seu sofrimento. Acrescente a estas duas graves razões para eu me apoquentar esta outra — que, à parte tudo aquilo, estou atravessando agora uma das minhas graves crises mentais. E imagine você que, para isto não ser tudo, essa crise mental é de várias espécies ao mesmo tempo, e por diversas razões.\\nSobreponha, agora, a isto tudo uma pressão de trabalho — não de um género, mas de várias espécies.\\nVocê calcula bem o que tem sido o resultado de tudo isto... Tenho desleixado tudo, fazendo só aquele trabalho que é absolutamente impossível não fazer.\\nTenho atrasado o meu trabalho de traduções. Há mais de um mês que tenho para traduzir um livro de 100 páginas pequenas, que, normalmente, eu traduziria em 5 dias. E ainda não tenho traduzidas senão 30 páginas! Vão sempre tarde as minhas cartas para minha família. Para você, você já sabe o que tem sido. É assim com tudo, numa força absurda de perder tempo, de navegar pela costa do Inútil, e outras metafrases análogas — que todas são poucas para o que hoje vivo.\\nIsto serve para justificar a minha demora em escrever-lhe. Mas o facto de esperar ansiosamente notícias suas, para lhe escrever mais calmamente, tem, também, contribuído um pouco para esta demora. Peço-lhe, meu querido Sá-Carneiro, milhares de desculpas.

       "  'text': '\\nLisboa, 24 de Junho de 1916\\nMinha querida Tia:\\n\\nMuito lhe agradeço a sua carta de 13 e os parabéns que me traz. Muito agradeço também a carta do Raúl de 22 de Maio, a que responderei brevemente; creio que assim posso prometer, porque me sinto agora já um pouco melhor, já mais apto a não ter a inércia que tenho tido e que, como calcula, tem sido devida aos sucessivos choques nervosos por que tenho passado.\\nFelizmente que chegaram (enfim!) de Pretória notícias acentuadamente boas. Excepto no que respeita ao braço, que está demorando em recuperar o movimento, o estado da Mamã melhorou muito. O estado mental está, enfim, normal. Aquela confusão mental que ela tinha, e que era o que mais me impressionava, desapareceu. E ela já sai do quarto, passando umas horas por dia na casa de jantar. \\nNão sei o tratamento empregado agora. Sei que, a princípio, empregaram, com efeito, os choques eléctricos, mas suspenderam esse tratamento, porque, ao que parece, incomodava demasiadamente a doente. E suponho que naquela altura da doença não seria bom o incómodo natural dos choques. Se assim foi, já terão, suponho, retomado esse tratamento.\\n\\nPor enquanto não há nada em que, de positivo, se deva assentar com respeito à guerra e às tropas de aqui irem para fora. E creio, mesmo, que os rapazes na situação do Raúl não correm, por enquanto, grande risco de serem chamados. É claro que não posso \\n\\nafirmar\\n\\n isto, mas é o que consta aqui. Já se o Raúl estivesse cá, naturalmente teria, pelo menos, a maçada de uma «escola de oficiais» ou qualquer aparelho parecido.\\n\\nSobre o estado nervoso em que tenho vivido, não tenho passado mal ultimamente. Também creio que não tem havido novidade na família, salvo que a Joaquina está umas vezes melhor, outras pior. Como eu tinha previsto, pela astrologia, a situação do Mário não só melhorou, mas parece tender para melhorar cada vez mais.\\nVamos agora ao caso misterioso que a interessa e que a tia Anica diz não poder calcular o que seja. Sim, não calcula, decerto eu próprio é o que menos esperaria.\\n\\nO facto é o seguinte. Aí por fins de Março (se não me engano) comecei a ser médium. Imagine! Eu, que (como deve recordar-se) era um elemento atrasador nas sessões semiespíritas que fazíamos, comecei, de repente, com a escrita automática. Estava uma vez em casa, de noite, tendo vindo da Brasileira, quando senti a vontade de, literalmente, pegar numa caneta e pô-la sobre o papel. É claro que depois é que dei por o facto de que tinha sido esse impulso. No momento, não reparei no facto, tomei-o como o facto, natural em quem está distraído, de pegar numa pena para fazer rabiscos. Nessa primeira sessão comecei por a \\n\\nassinatura \\n\\n(bem conhecida de mim) «Manuel Gualdino da Cunha». Eu nem de longe estava pensando no tio Cunha. Depois escrevi mais umas cousas, sem relevo, nem interesse nem importância.\\n\\nDe vez em quando, umas vezes voluntariamente, outras obrigado, escrevo. Mas raras vezes são «comunicações» compreensíveis. Certas frases percebem-se. E há sobretudo uma cousa curiosíssima — uma tendência irritante para me responder a perguntas com números; assim como há a tendência para desenhar. Não são desenhos de cousas, mas de sinais cabalísticos e maçónicos, símbolos do ocultismo e cousas assim que me perturbam um pouco. Não é nada que se pareça com a escrita automática da Tia Anica ou da Maria — uma narrativa, uma série de respostas em linguagem coerente. É assim mais imperfeito, mas muito mais misterioso.\\nDevo dizer que o pretenso espírito do tio Cunha nunca mais se manifestou pela escrita (nem de outra maneira). As comunicações actuais são, por assim dizer, anónimas e sempre que pergunto «quem é que fala?» faz-me desenhos ou escreve-me números.\\nMando-lhe, junta, uma amostra simples, que não é preciso devolver-me. Nesta há números e rabiscos, mas quase que não há desenhos. É o que tenho aqui à mão. É para verem como é o aspecto das minhas comunicações.\\nÉ singular que, apesar de eu não perceber nada de tais números, consultei um amigo meu, ocultista e magnetizador (uma criatura muito curiosa e interessante, além de ser um excelente amigo) e ele disse-me cousas singulares. Por exemplo, eu disse-lhe uma vez que tinha escrito um número qualquer (de quatro algarismos) de que não me recordo agora. Ele respondeu-me que havia cinco pessoas na casa onde eu estava. E, com efeito, assim era. Mas ele não me diz de onde é que concluiu isso. Explicou-me apenas que esse facto de eu escrever números era prova da autenticidade da minha escrita automática — isto é, de que não era autosugestão, mas mediunidade legítima. Os espíritos — diz ele — fazem essas comunicações para dar essa garantia; e essas comunicações são, por isso mesmo, incompreensíveis ao médium, e de ordem que mesmo o inconsciente dele era incapaz de imaginar (?).\\nEste meu amigo tem-me explicado outros números assim, com igual, e curiosa, segurança. Só houve três números que ele não compreendeu.\\nEstou contando rapidamente, e claro, e necessariamente omito pormenores e detalhes interessantes. O que narro, porém, é o essencial.\\n\\nNão pára aqui a minha mediunidade. Descobri uma outra espécie de qualidade mediúnica, que até aqui eu não só nunca sentira, mas que, por assim dizer, só sentia negativamente. Quando o Sá-Carneiro atravessava em Paris a grande crise mental, que o havia de levar ao suicídio, \\n\\neu senti a crise aqui\\n\\n, caiu sobre mim uma súbita \\n\\ndepressão vinda do exterior\\n\\n, que eu, ao momento, não consegui explicar-me. Esta forma de sensibilidade não tem tido continuação.\\n\\nGuardo, porém, para o fim o detalhe mais interessante. É que estou desenvolvendo qualidades não só de médium escrevente, mas também de médium vidente. Começo a ter aquilo a que os ocultistas chamam «a visão astral», e também a chamada «visão etérica». Tudo isto está muito em princípio, mas não admite dúvidas. É tudo, por enquanto, imperfeito e em certos momentos só, mas nesses momentos existe.\\n\\nHá momentos, por exemplo, em que tenho perfeitamente alvoradas (?) de «visão etérica» — em que vejo a «aura magnética» de algumas pessoas, e, sobretudo, a minha ao espelho e, no escuro, irradiando-me das mãos. Não é alucinação porque o que eu vejo outros vêem-no, pelo menos, um outro, com qualidades destas mais desenvolvidas. Cheguei, num momento feliz de visão etérica, a ver na Brasileira do Rossio, de manhã, \\n\\nas costelas de um indivíduo através do fato e da pele\\n\\n. Isto é que é a visão etérica em seu pleno grau. Chegarei eu a tê-la realmente, isto é, mais nítida e sempre que quiser?\\n\\nA «visão astral» está muito imperfeita. Mas às vezes, de noite, fecho os olhos e há uma sucessão de pequenos quadros, muito rápidos, muito nítidos (tão nítidos como qualquer cousa do mundo exterior). Há figuras estranhas, desenhos, sinais simbólicos, números (também já tenho visto números), etc.\\nE há — o que é uma sensação muito curiosa — por vezes o sentir-me de repente pertença de qualquer outra cousa. O meu braço direito, por exemplo, começa a ser-me levantado no ar sem eu querer. (É claro que posso resistir, mas o facto é que não o quis levantar nessa ocasião.) Outras vezes sou feito cair para um lado, como se estivesse magnetizado, etc.\\nPerguntará a Tia Anica em que é que isto me perturba, e em que é que estes fenómenos — aliás ainda tão rudimentares — me incomodam? Não é o susto. Há mais curiosidade do que susto, ainda que haja às vezes cousas que metem um certo respeito, como quando, várias vezes, olhando para o espelho, a minha cara desaparece e me surge um fácies de homem de barbas, ou um outro qualquer (são quatro, ao todo, os que assim me aparecem).\\nO que me incomoda um pouco é que eu sei pouco mais ou menos o que isto significa. Não julgue que é a loucura. Não é: dá-se até o facto curioso de, em matéria de equilíbrio mental, eu estar bem como nunca estive. É que tudo isto não é o vulgar desenvolvimento de qualidades de médium. Já sei o bastante das ciências ocultas para reconhecer que estão sendo acordados em mim os sentidos chamados superiores para um fim qualquer que o Mestre desconhecido, que assim me vai iniciando, ao impor-me essa existência superior, me vai dar um sofrimento muito maior do que até aqui tenho tido, e aquele desgosto profundo de tudo que vem com a aquisição destas altas faculdades. Além disso, já o próprio alvorecer dessas faculdades é acompanhado duma misteriosa sensação de isolamento e de abandono que enche de amargura até ao fundo da alma.\\nEnfim, será o que tiver de ser.\\nEu não digo tudo, porque nem tudo se pode dizer.\\nMas digo o bastante para que, vagamente, me compreenda.\\nNão sei se realmente julgará que estou doido. Creio que não. Estas cousas são anormais sim, mas não antinaturais.\\nPedia-lhe o favor de não falar nisto a ninguém. Não há vantagem nenhuma, e há muitas desvantagens (algumas, talvez, de ordem desconhecida) em fazê-lo.\\nAdeus, minha querida Tia. Saudades à Maria e ao Raúl. Beijos ao Eduardinho. Para si muitos e muitos abraços do seu sobrinho muito amigo e grato\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Fernando\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\n\\nToda a metafísica é a procura da verdade, entendendo por Verdade, a verdade absoluta. Ora a Verdade, seja ela o que for, e admitindo que seja qualquer coisa, se existe existe ou dentro das minhas sensações, ou fora delas ou tanto dentro como fora delas. Se existe fora das minhas sensações, é uma coisa de que eu nunca posso estar certo, não existe para mim portanto, é, para mim, não só o contrário da certeza, porque só das minhas sensações estou certo, mas o contrário de \\n\\nser \\n\\nporque a única coisa que existe para mim são as minhas sensações. De modo que, a existir fora das minhas sensações, a Verdade é para mim igual a Incerteza e não-ser — não existe e não é verdade, portanto. Mas concedamos o absurdo que de que as minhas sensações possam ser o erro, e o não-ser (o que é absurdo, visto que elas, com certeza, existem) — nesse caso a verdade é o ser e existe fora das minhas sensações \\n\\ntotalmente\\n\\n.\\n\\n \\n\\nMas a ideia \\n\\nVerdade \\n\\né uma ideia minha; existe, por isso dentro das minhas sensações: portanto, ou quero Verdade Absoluta e fora de mim, ou verdade existente dentro de mim — contradição, portanto, erro, consequentemente.\\n\\n\\nA outra hipótese é que verdade existe dentro das minhas sensações. Nesse caso ou é a soma delas todas, ou é uma delas, ou parte delas. Se é uma delas, em que se distingue das outras? Se é uma sensação, não se distingue \\n\\nessencialmente \\n\\ndas outras; e para que se distinguisse, era preciso que se distinguisse, essencialmente. E se não é uma sensação, não é uma sensação. — Se é parte das minhas sensações, que parte? As sensações têm duas faces — a de serem \\n\\nsentidas \\n\\ne a de serem dadas como coisas sentidas, a parte pela qual são minhas e a parte pela qual são de «coisas». É uma destas partes, que a Verdade, a ser parte das minhas sensações, tem de ser. (Se é de qualquer modo um grupo de sensações unificando-se ao constituir uma só sensação, cai sob a garra do raciocínio que conduz à hipótese anterior). Se é uma das duas faces — qual? A face «subjectiva»? Ora essa face subjectiva aparece-me sob uma das duas formas — ou a da minha «individualidade» una ou de uma múltipla individualidade «minha». No primeiro caso é \\n\\numa \\n\\nsensação minha como qualquer outra e já fica refutada no argumento anterior. No segundo caso, essa verdade é múltipla e diversa, é \\n\\nverdades \\n\\n— o que é contraditório com a ideia de Verdade, valha ela o que valer. Será então a face objectiva? O mesmo argumento se aplica, porque ou é uma unificação dessas sensações \\n\\nnuma \\n\\nideia de \\n\\num \\n\\nmundo exterior — e essa ideia ou não é nada ou é uma sensação minha, e se é uma sensação, já fica refutada essa hipótese; ou é de um múltiplo mundo exterior, e isso reduz-se às minhas sensações, então pluralidade de modos é a essência da ideia de Verdade.\\n\\n\\nResta analisar se a \\n\\nVerdade \\n\\né o misto das minhas sensações. Essas sensações ou são tomadas como um ou como muitos. No primeiro caso voltamos à já rejeitada hipótese. No segundo caso a \\n\\nVerdade \\n\\ncomo ideia desaparece, porque se consubstancia com a totalidade das minhas sensações. Mas para ser a totalidade das minhas sensações, mesmo concebidas como minhas sensações, nuamente, a verdade fica dispersa — desaparece. Porque, ou se baseia na ideia de totalidade, que é uma ideia (ou sensação) nossa, ou não se apoia em parte nenhuma. Mas nada prova, mesmo, a identidade de verdade e totalidade. Portanto, a verdade não existe.\\n\\nMas nós temos a ideia ...\\nTemos, mas vemos que não corresponde a «Realidade» nenhuma, suposto que Realidade significa qualquer coisa. A Verdade é, portanto, uma ideia ou sensação nossa, não sabemos de quê, sem significado, portanto sem valor, como qualquer outra sensação nossa.\\n\\nFicamos portanto com as nossas sensações por única «realidade», inútil que realmente tem aqui certo valor, mas é uma conveniência para frasear. De «real» temos apenas as nossas sensações, mas «real» (que é uma sensação nossa) não significa nada, nem mesmo «significa» significar qualquer coisa, nem sensação tem um sentido, nem «tem um sentido» é coisa que tenha sentido algum. Tudo é o mesmo mistério. Reparo, porém em que nem \\n\\ntudo \\n\\npode significar coisa alguma, um «mistério» é palavra que não tem significação.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Álvaro de Campos’ Ultimatum was published in the first...\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nÁlvaro de Campos’ Ultimatum was published in the first and (at least up to now) only number of «Portugal Futurista», a literary publication the nature of which is sufficiently expressed by its title, which needs no translation.\\nHaving, through some inexplicable stroke of luck, passed the press-censors, the luck ceased when someone called the attention of the authorities to it, after the review was on the booksellers’ windows. The «PF» was immediately seized by the police, and proceedings instituted against all the authors colaborating. This (it is well to explain) was under the Democratic ministry which was thrown out of power by Sidónio Pais, with the Revolution of the 5th Decr. t917. Yet it is difficult to imagine how any ministry at all, when the country was at war, could allow the publication of the Ultimatum, which, original and magnificent as it is, and though not pro-German (being anti everything, Allied and German), contains scathing insults on the Allies, as also on Portugal and Brazil, the very countries for which the «PF» was certainly destined.\\n\\nMy reason for translating the Ultimatum is that it is quite the cleverest piece of literature called into being by the Great War. We may stare at its theories as unspeakably excentric, we may disagree with the excessive violence of the introductory invective, but no one, I believe, can but confess that the satiric part is magnificent in its studied preciseness of application, and that the theoretic part, whatever we think of the value of the theories, has at least the rare merits of originality and freshness.\\nThese are good reasons why the Ultimatum should be translated, and the fact that, though it has been in print since Sept. 1917, I only now translate it, is due to the fact, which the perusal of the work will render evident, that no such publication could be printed while the war lasted.\\nIt remains to say something to the English reader both concerning the nature of the work and of the author. The tendency of the work is quite clear — the dissatisfaction at the constructive incapacity which characterizes our age, where no great poet, no great statesman, or even, all things well considered, no great general even, has made his appearance. Álvaro de Campos, speaking about the Ultimatum, said once to me: «This war is the war of the lesser pigmies against the greater pigmies. Time will show (this was said in January 1918) which are the greater, and which are the lesser, but they are pigmies one way and another.» «It matters little who wins the war, for a fool is sure to win it. It matters little what comes out of it all, for folly is sure to come. The age of physical engineering has already arrived (he characteristically added), but the age of mental engineering is yet far off. It shows how much we have receded from the Greek and Roman civilization and what a crime Christism has been against the substance of culture and progress.» «That low sophist, President Wilson», he once said to me, «is the type and symbol of our age. He has never said a concrete thing in his life. He could not say a concrete thing to save what I suppose he considers his soul.»\\nThese are almost the exact words, which, as they were spoken in English, I am less likely to forget.\\nÁlvaro de Campos was born in Lisbon on the 13th October 1890 and travelled extensively in the East and through Europe, staying chiefly in Scotland.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nNão posso aceitar a atitude crítica de Ricardo Reis para com a obra de Caeiro. Ricardo Reis elogia a obra de Caeiro, não por ser uma obra de arte, mas por ser uma obra de verdade. Não aceito, repito. Tenho a obra de Caeiro por bela independentemente da verdade que contenha ou até não contenha. E é por isso mesmo que chamo à obra de Caeiro uma obra de arte.\\nÉ obra de arte tudo aquilo que produz uma emoção de prazer independentemente de satisfação, utilidade ou verdade. Repudio o chamado nu artístico, porque dá, ou desde que dê, uma sensação sexual, isto é, uma sensação, embora fruste, de satisfação; pois toda a emoção sexual é um prazer de satisfação, e não simplesmente um prazer. A chamada arte industrial só é arte se nela se não atendeu à utilidade do objecto em que se aplicou. Desde que um cartaz visa a produzir um efeito puramente publicitário, pode ser um bom cartaz, mas pode ser também uma má obra de arte. E - chegamos ao ponto - desde que numa frase interesse a verdade que ela contém, ou que ela interesse pela verdade que possa conter, essa frase pode pertencer à filosofia; deixa de pertencer à arte.\\nQuando Caeiro diz, «A Natureza é partes sem um todo» o que nos dá a emoção de prazer é a frase e não a sua verdade possível, ou o aceitarmo-la por verdadeira. Mas é a frase por ser assim como é, na sua vividez paradoxal. Se Caeiro houvesse dito a mesma coisa de outra maneira, da maneira filosófica - por exemplo, «A Natureza é essencialmente plural, e é impossível reduzi-la a unidade», nada haveria de belo no dizer; a própria ideia perde a realidade, descarna-se, é esqueleto e filosofia.\\nÉ por isto que discordei sempre da tese posta por Fernando Pessoa, de que a filosofia é uma das artes. Achei sempre que a filosofia era uma ciência virtual, ou uma tentativa de ciência, ou uma ciência fruste. Há nos filósofos frases casuais que têm poesia, e grande poesia. Mas são as frases só. Quando Platão diz «Deus geometriza», isto é belo independentemente de Deus geometrizar, ou até existir. É belo porque exprime em cor e corpo uma ideia grande.\\nA poesia é toda aquela forma da arte literária em que se recebe uma emoção estética por motivos independentes do sentido da frase.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nLisboa, 4 de Junho de 1915\\n\\n\\nExm.º Senhor Director do \\n\\nDiário de Notícias,\\n\\n\\n\\nE/V.\\n\\n\\nRegressando ontem a Lisboa, só então tive ocasião de ler uma crítica, há poucos dias publicada no jornal que V. Ex.ª proficientemente dirige, ao extraordinário livro do sr. Mário de Sá-Carneiro, meu ilustre camarada \\n\\ndo Orpheu.\\n\\n\\nNão é à crítica que me quero referir, porque ninguém pode esperar ser compreendido antes que os outros aprendam a língua em que fala. Repontar com isso seria além de absurdo, indício de um grave desconhecimento da história literária, onde os génios inovadores foram sempre, quando não tratados como doidos (como Verlaine e Mallarmé), tratados como parvos (como Wordsworth, Keats e Rossetti) ou como, além de parvos, inimigos da pátria, da religião e da moralidade, como aconteceu a Antero de Quental, sobretudo nos significativos panfletos de José Feliciano de Castilho, que, aliás não era nenhum idiota.\\n\\nNão é a isto que me quero referir. O que quero acentuar, acentuar bem, acentuar muito bem, é que é preciso que cesse a trapalhada, que a ignorância dos nossos críticos está fazendo, com a palavra \\n\\nfuturismo. \\n\\nFalar em futurismo, quer a propósito do 1º nº \\n\\nOrpheu \\n\\nquer a propósito do livro do sr. Sá-Carneiro, é a coisa mais disparatada que se pode imaginar. Nenhum futurista tragaria o \\n\\nOrpheu. O Orpheu \\n\\nseria, para um futurista, uma lamentável demonstração de espírito obscurantista e reaccionário.\\n\\n\\nA atitude principal do futurismo é a Objectividade Absoluta, a eliminação, da arte, de tudo quanto é \\n\\nalma, \\n\\nquanto é sentimento, emoção, lirismo, subjectividade em suma. O futurismo é dinâmico e analítico por excelência. Ora se há coisa que [seja] típica do Interseccionismo (tal é o nome do movimento português) é a subjectividade excessiva, a síntese levada ao máximo, o exagero da atitude \\n\\nestática. \\n\\n«Drama estático», mesmo, se intitula uma peça, inserta no 1.º número do \\n\\nOrpheu, \\n\\ndo sr. Fernando Pessoa. E o tédio, o sonho, a abstracção são as atitudes usuais dos poetas meus colegas naquela brilhante revista.\\n\\n\\nA César o que é de César. Aos Interseccionistas, chame-se interseccionistas. Ou chame-se-lhes \\n\\npaúlicos, \\n\\nse\\n\\n \\n\\nse quiser. Esse termo, ao menos, caracteriza-os, distinguindo-os de outra qualquer escola. Englobar os colaboradores do \\n\\nOrpheu \\n\\nno futurismo é nem sequer saber dizer disparates, o que é lamentabilíssimo.\\n\\n\\nNo 2.º número do \\n\\nOrpheu \\n\\nvirá colaboração realmente futurista, é certo. Então se poderá ver a diferença, se bem que seja, não literária, mas pictural essa colaboração. São quatro quadros que emanam da alta sensibilidade moderna do meu amigo Santa Rita Pintor.\\n\\nAté aqui tenho falado em geral, mais pelos meus colegas do que por mim. O meu caso é diferente. Permita-me V. Ex.ª que me refira a ele.\\n\\nA minha \\n\\nOde Triunfal, \\n\\nno 1º número do \\n\\nOrpheu, \\n\\né a única coisa que se aproxima do futurismo. Mas aproxima-se pelo assunto que me inspirou, não pela realização — e em arte a forma de realizar é que caracteriza e distingue as correntes e as escolas.\\n\\nEu, de resto, nem sou interseccionista (ou paúlico) nem futurista. Sou eu, apenas eu, preocupado apenas comigo e com as minhas sensações.\\nEspero da lealdade jornalística de V. Ex.ª a inserção desta carta em lugar onde pelo menos os jornalistas a leiam. Na impossibilidade de fazer os nossos críticos compreender, tentemos ao menos levá-los a fingir que compreendem.\\n\\nDe V. Ex.ª\\nCdo. Venr. e Obgdo.\\n\\nÁLVARO DE CAMPOS\\nengenheiro e poeta sensacionista\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nÁLVARO DE CAMPOS, ENGENHEIRO NAVAL E POETA FUTURISTA \\n\\nconcede ao [jornal «...»] uma entrevista sensacional: \\xa0A situação da Inglaterra — A situação da Europa — A situação de Portugal\\n\\nPontos de vista originalíssimos\\n\\n\\nA estada ocasional em Lisboa, vindo de Newcastle-upon-Tyne, de Álvaro de Campos, engenheiro naval da casa Forsyth e um dos mais célebres colaboradores do celebrado \\n\\nOrpheu, \\n\\nsugeriu-nos a ideia de inquirir o que pensaria do estado actual de coisas em Portugal, sobretudo relacionando-o com o da Europa (e isso era, para nós, o ponto mais interessante), um dos espíritos mais originais e brilhantes do que talvez já se não possa continuar chamando «a nova geração».\\n\\nEncontrámos Álvaro de Campos no Terreiro do Paço, por uma coincidência feliz, quando ele ia, ainda com tempo, para tomar o vapor para o rápido do Algarve. E a nossa primeira pergunta, passadas as saudações iniciais, foi esta:\\n— A situação actual em Inglaterra?\\n— Muito má industrialmente hoje, e portanto muito má politicamente amanhã.\\nA crise industrial deriva de causas algumas antigas, outras modernas, de causas algumas economicamente certas, outras economicamente fictícias. O mal é radical. Os governos têm sido de uma notável incapacidade na solução dos principais problemas com que têm sido confrontados — o problema industrial propriamente dito, o problema do desemprego, o próprio problema do alojamento. A Grã-Bretanha continua entretendo-se demasiado com as velhas ficções políticas, relíquias de uma época extinta. Ainda há muita gente em Inglaterra que tem no íntimo da alma a convicção de que uma eleição geral é uma coisa no género e da categoria de uma lei da natureza, e de que a «vontade do povo» é frase que comporta qualquer espécie de sentido. O que há de mais estranho nos indivíduos políticos é o pouco que conseguem aprender com a experiência flagrante. Metem-se-lhes na cabeça certas ideias, e atravessam a vida com essas ideias, embora a experiência quotidianamente as desminta. Desde que o desmentido não seja violento — e assim é em todas as sociedades em que, como a inglesa, se não está em estado revolucionário —, o apego às velhas fórmulas e às ficções mortas persiste, o sonho idiota dos bons tempos, em que estas ideias eram tão falsas como são hoje e também ninguém dava por isso.\\nOs políticos destes países pacíficos e ordeiros dão-me a impressão, quando se aproxima deles um período de agitação e de revolução, de homens que quisessem andar sobre água pela razão de a água apresentar, como a terra, uma superfície lisa. Empregam a experiência de um passado que foi uma coisa para lhes servir em um futuro que é outra coisa. Se lêem história, lêem-na como se fosse só livros, e não coisas que acontecessem. Estou certo que um inglês tem a ideia obscura de que guerra civil e revolução são, em Inglaterra, coisas que se deram no século XVII, como se fossem os números das datas, e por isso se não podem tornar a dar.\\nOs políticos ingleses, que são inteligentes para os problemas secundários e de uma estupidez crassa para os problemas fundamentais, andam a dizer, e com eles grande parte dos jornais, que a «maioria» do operariado, do operariado «são», como eles dizem (a frase, é claro, não quer dizer nada), não está com os comunistas. É de impacientar um cristal este modo [de] pensar. Que diabo importa que a maioria do operariado «esteja» ou «não esteja» com os extremistas, quando os extremistas levam essa maioria passiva para onde querem? Que diabo importa que a maioria do operariado não concorde com o extremismo, se a maioria do operariado não está organizada, e o comunismo inglês está? Que importa a opinião dessa «maioria», se ela pensa politicamente, e o comunismo revolucionariamente? Em tempo de paz, e de eleições gerais (e os políticos ingleses julgam que as eleições gerais são a chave do universo), está bem que um milhão de eleitores valha mais que dez mil eleitores. Mas em tempo de guerra um milhão de gente organizada para a paz não vale um exército de dez mil homens expressamente organizado para a guerra. Os políticos ingleses julgam que as revoluções não se podem fazer quando a maioria do país não quer; quando as revoluções, para se fazerem, exigem apenas uma minoria audaz organizada para as fazer, e capaz de as fazer. A massa do país nunca importa. Julga alguém que o «povo» faz revoluções? Julga alguém que o regime russo actual é maioritário? Porque há tanta gente estúpida no mundo, o sr. sabe?\\nA maioria é essencialmente espectadora. As próprias eleições, dada a complexidade e o custo do maquinismo eleitoral, nunca podem ser vencidas senão por partidos eleitoralmente organizados. O eleitor não escolhe o que quer; escolhe entre isto e aquilo que lhe dão, o que é diferente. Tudo é oligárquico na vida das sociedades. A democracia é o mais estúpido de todos os mitos, porque nem sequer tem carácter místico.\\n— [O que pensa v. da questão social?]\\n— Não há questão social — creio que é «questão social» que as bestas dizem — em parte nenhuma. A Europa é hoje o teatro de um grande conflito, de um conflito ligeiramente triangular. Estão em guerra, no mundo, duas grandes forças — a plutocracia industrial e a plutocracia financeira. A plutocracia industrial com o seu tipo de mentalidade organizadora, a plutocracia financeira com o seu tipo de mentalidade especulativa; a industrial com a sua índole mais ou menos nacionalista, porque a indústria tem raízes, e liga portanto com as outras forças que as têm, a financeira com a sua índole mais ou menos internacional, porque não tem raízes, e não liga portanto senão consigo mesma, ou, então só com aquela raça praticamente privilegiada que, através da finança internacional, se pode dizer que hoje, sem ter pátria, governa e dirige as pátrias todas.\\nMas as forças proletárias, o bolchevismo, o radicalismo?\\n\\n— Isso são mitos. Não há correntes proletárias, não há bolchevismo (nem na Rússia), não há radicalismo em parte nenhuma. Tudo isso é o avesso da plutocracia financeira, e é provadamente dirigido e financiado por ela. Não há movimento nenhum de ordem radical que não seja movido, em última causa, pelo \\n\\nFrankfurter Bund, \\n\\nou\\n\\n \\n\\npor qualquer outro organismo derivado da Internacional Financeira, que é a autêntica internacional. Os operários são todos uns idiotas, e os seus chefes, ou idiotas também, ou loucos; todos são elementos essencialmente sugestionáveis, instrumentos inconscientes de forças de cuja existência muitos deles nem sequer suspeitam. No congresso recente das Associações de Classe inglesas \\n\\n(Trade Unions), \\n\\nforam votadas várias moções de carácter extremista; mas é singular que todas elas visam coisas que deixam livre o «capitalismo» internacional. A execução dos princípios consignados nessas moções importaria a ruína da indústria inglesa, e a do império britânico; deixaria porém de pé todas as forças e meios de acção do autêntico capitalismo, da finança internacional. :É interessante este extremismo, não é? Foi precipitada, disse-se, a redacção dessas moções; mas é curioso que a precipitação nunca atingiu o fenómeno máximo do capitalismo, sendo elas todas dirigidas contra o capitalismo...\\n\\n— [E a situação em Portugal?]\\n— Portugal é uma plutocracia financeira de espécie asinina. É, como todos os países modernos, excepto, talvez, a Itália, uma oligarquia de simuladores. Mas é uma oligarquia de simuladores provincianos, pouco industriados na própria histeria postiça. Ninguém já engana ninguém — o que é tristíssimo — na terra natal do Conto do Vigário. Não temos senão os vigaristas de praça como prova de qualquer sobrevivência das qualidades de intrujice da nação. Ora um país sem grandes intrujões é um país perdido, porque a civilização, em qualquer dos seus níveis, é essencialmente a organização da artificialidade, isto é, da intrujice. «Quem não intruja não come»; é esta a forma sociológica dum provérbio que o povo não sabe dizer, porque o povo nunca sabe dizer nada. De resto, a sociologia também não existe.\\n— Assistiu a alguma sessão do julgamento do 18 de Abril?\\n\\n— «Para quê? As farsas não me divertem. O 18 de Abril — em que, aliás, não surgiu um único elemento intelectualmente superior, nem um chefe — porque ser chefe não é ser vencido — foi simplesmente o conflito entre duas correntes que, com igual intensidade, presentemente agitam Portugal. Há em Portugal hoje duas correntes perfeitamente definidas: a que acha insuportável este estado de coisas; e a que descrê de todos os processos revolucionários para o resolver. Essas duas correntes chocaram-se no 18 de Abril, e venceu a segunda. Eis tudo. O resto é uma farsa de questões pessoais que não interessa senão idiotas. Os homens não importam, de um lado ou de outro; o que importa é as correntes essenciais, que esses homens, de um lado e de outro, de uma maneira e de outra, temporariamente incarnaram. Que importa que fulano tivesse dado a sua palavra que fazia isto ou aquilo, ou alguém supusesse por ter ouvido dizer a sicrano, que parece que o soubera de beltrano, que essa palavra estava dada? O que importa é o conflito do país consigo mesmo, a guerra civil na alma nacional. O país hoje quer duas coisas ao mesmo tempo: quer mudança, e não quer revoluções. É a quadratura do círculo a resolver \\n\\nin anima vili.\\n\\n\\n— O que há a fazer, então?\\n— Para nos salvarmos? Aderir antecipadamente ao futuro império de Israel. Os judeus têm ganha a primeira batalha; ganharam-na em Moscóvia, como ali a perdeu Napoleão. No devido tempo ganharão também o seu Waterloo. A civilização europeia actual está moribunda. Não é o capitalismo, nem a burguesia, nem nenhuma outra dessas fórmulas vazias que está morrendo; é a civilização actual — a civilização greco-romana e cristã. Já nada a pode salvar. Poderíamos pensar, um tempo, em nos salvarmos com a plutocracia industrial, mas como, se a plutocracia industrial está caindo? se está caindo em proveito da plutocracia financeira?\\n— Mas como é que aderiremos antecipadamente ao futuro império de Israel, supondo que ele venha?\\n— Desintegrando propositadamente todas as forças contrárias, esforçando-nos por escangalhar a indústria nacional, por aluir o pouco que resta de influência católica (excepto ritualmente não é de grande coisa), por substituir uma cultura técnica à cultura clássica, por desintegrar a família no seu sentimento tradicional. . .\\n— Mas isso é monstruoso! E é v., um engenheiro, que fala de desintegrar a indústria?\\n\\n— É monstruoso, é; a vida é frequentemente monstruosa. E quanto a eu, engenheiro, falar em desintegrar a indústria, não me refiro à indústria senão como indústria nacional. Não digo «desintegrar a técnica». Devemos criar a humanidade dos técnicos... Alguma coisa disto — antes de toda a orientação neste sentido que tem surgido adentro do bolchevismo, dirigida de cima, de fora, e por mão de mestre —, já eu tinha proclamado a essência no meu \\n\\nUltimatum \\n\\nde 1917, publicado no número único do \\n\\nPortugal Futurista \\n\\nnesse mesmo ano.\\n\\n— Mas isso é bolchevismo!\\n— Não é, e é. Não é bolchevismo porque nada vai aqui de interesse pelas plebes, pelos operários, que devem ser reduzidos a uma condição de escravatura ainda mais intensa e rígida que aquilo a que eles chamam a «escravatura» capitalista. A massa humana deve ser compelida a amalgamar-se numa classe composta do actual proletariado e dos restos das classes médias.\\n— Mas o que tem o Império de Israel com o império dos técnicos?\\n— Essencialmente, nada. Mas o único império que pode haver é o de Israel, e a única maneira de realizar hoje um império é utilizando a técnica, que é o característico distintivo da nossa época. Bem vê, uma coisa é império, propriamente dito, outra coisa o processo pelo qual se mantém e conserva.\\nTodas as civilizações, parece, nascem de um domínio de uma nação sobre outra, de uma classe sobre outra. Um velho sociólogo, dos mais notáveis, embora esquecido, Stuart Glennie, expôs há uns bons trinta anos esta teoria. Deixe ver... Talvez me recorde da sua definição de civilização, colhida através do exame mais exaustivo que se pode fazer dos mitos e dos usos primitivos.\\n— Pareceu-nos sempre que essa história do «judaísmo» e do perigo judeu era uma madureza de fanáticos. . .\\n— Nalgumas das suas manifestações, é. Mas na essência não é madureza nenhuma. Madureza seria, sem dúvida, a de alguém que no tempo de Tibério ou de Nero se lembrasse de dizer que o Império Romano corria risco de ser absorvido, conquistado, por uma obscura seita judaica chamada o cristianismo.

       "  'text': '\\n«Cancioneiro» é, como a mesma palavra o diz, uma colectânea (colecção) de Canções. Canção é, propriamente, todo aquele poema que contém emoção bastante para que pareça ser feito para se cantar, isto é, para nele existir naturalmente o auxílio, ainda que implícito, da música.\\n\\nPode ser narrativo, como quando é balada; (...) o que não pode ser, por um lado, é longo, pois o canto não pode durar muito, e o libreto de uma ópera não é mais que uma colecção de canções; por outro lado, é epigramático, ou vazado em moldes semelhantes aos do epigrama, pois o epigrama é o poema destituído de emoção, excepto a mínima inexcluível de tudo quanto é humano, e os moldes da poesia de estilo epigramático excluem a musicalidade. Por isso se não pode chamar canção a um soneto, que é um epigrama de catorze versos, dispostos em duas quadras e dois tercetos, como no soneto regular, ou em três quadras e um dístico\\n\\n, \\n\\ncomo no soneto Shakespeariano.\\n\\n[Dissemos que devemos chamar canção um poema] que contém emoção bastante para parecer que nele se está cantando. A canção exclui, portanto, tudo quanto se não pode cantar. Não se pode cantar o que é longo; não se pode cantar o que é duro; não se pode cantar o que é rígido e formal. Por isso a canção exclui o poema longo, exclui o poema satírico, exclui o epigrama e todo poema que se serve de uma forma rígida, como, por exemplo, o soneto. Salvas essas limitações, todo poema é uma canção.\\nNão pode chamar-se canção o que exclui o elemento musical. Por isso não pode chamar-se canção a um poema em verso irregular ou livre, nem a um poema onde não haja rima.\\n',\n",

A primeira é o fim a que visa, que é a acção útil do espírito construtivo.\\n\\n \\n\\nA segunda é a conquista da liberdade.\\n\\nAs grandes épocas da história são aquelas em que os povos lutaram pela liberdade, não aquelas em que eles a obtiveram; que estas só estão acima das épocas de baixo despotismo, e estão acima, talvez, apenas pelo conforto, e por mais nada. Pode o leitor buscar na história os exemplos que quiser. Um só bastará, que citemos. Qual é a época mais valiosa na história inglesa, mais produtora de grandes homens e de grandes coisas: a actual, em que a liberdade está conquistada, ou a que vai da época de Henrique Oitavo à de Carlos Segundo, onde se travaram os combates pela liberdade? Mesmo a época actual, com as liberdades conseguidas, valerá, em qualquer campo salvo no das liberdades conseguidas, a época contemporânea da Revolução Francesa e que acabou, propriamente, na Reforma Parlamentar de 1832?\\nHá, porém, a distinguir. É fecunda a época em que se combate contra uma opressão verdadeira, contra uma opressão que viola a acção das leis sociais; não é fecunda aquela em que se combate contra uma opressão que não é, afinal, senão a das próprias leis sociais. Por isso o combate contra Carlos I em Inglaterra foi fecundo, e não o é o combate contra o capitalismo e contra a propriedade individual, que se tenta hoje.\\nLiberdade é um termo negativo: significa ausêsncia de opressão, ausência de compulsão directa. Erigir em princípios positivos elementos puramente negativos, higidamente negativos, foi o erro da Revolução Francesa. Por isso todo o combate contra a opressão verdadeira é um combate pela liberdade; ao passo que um combate pela opressão suposta é apenas um combate pela indisciplina.\\nA liberdade, no sentido de liberdade individual, é um erro; a liberdade que vale é a liberdade colectiva, ou, melhor, a liberdade que consiste na igualdade perante a lei, na liberdade de cada qual no seu mister, e na (…)\\nMas, uma vez conquistada a liberdade hígida, ninguém pode mandar os povos parar na marcha, que a seguir começam, para uma liberdade mórbida. Enquanto houver mundo há leis que pesam sobre nós, e, criado que seja o espírito de revolta, que é da substância do homem social, não o poderemos (como não podemos) fazê-lo parar; haverá essa marcha, conseguida a liberdade real, para a fictícia, porque, tornada positiva a ideia de liberdade, ela breve se apresenta como fim, em vez de meio, e o homem passa a buscar ser livre em aquelas coisas onde a própria constituição da sociedade não permitte que ele o seja. E assim começa a decadência. Porque a decadência é inevitável nas sociedades, como a morte em tudo quanto vive, e o que é composto de vidas, forçosamente que vive, seja organismo o nome que lhe demos, seja pessoa social, seja outro nome qualquer.\\nO progresso indefinido é um dos mais absurdos, anti-históricos e anti-científicos dos dogmas revolucionarios.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nMas o problema essencial da democracia moderna está na maneira como se hão-de conciliar o princípio democrático, que, seja porque razões seja, se tornou necessário às sociedades modernas (e talvez, se virmos bem, a todas as sociedades) e aquele princípio aristocrático que evidentemente constitui a base de tudo quanto seja orientação e governo.\\nO que há de mais interessante na dificuldade de resolver este problema é que as soluções têm constantemente sido procuradas fora da esfera onde elas devem estar; há outro detalhe mais interessante ainda, que é que a solução, que se procura, já fora encontrada. E, a não ser essa a solução a aplicar, não há outra possível que não seja no mesmo género.\\nEssa solução é a religião cristã; aí se encontram, unidos, de seu início, os sentimentos aristocrático e democrático (popular). O livre-pensamento moderno, com o seu feitio dogmático e categórico, herdado que foi do pior dogmatismo religioso, nunca podia encontrar esta solução, porque, não sendo realmente livre-pensamento não a podia procurar. O livre-pensador parte do princípio que tem de encontrar a solução para esse (como para qualquer outro) problema fora da religião: assim a sua liberdade começa por um dogmatismo. O livre-pensador exclui um elemento social (a religião) ao procurar resolver problemas sociais; nunca pergunta a si-próprio se a solução não estará acaso nesse fenómeno religioso, que arbitrariamente excluiu. A sua orientação nem sequer é decentemente sociológica. porque procura sempre soluções sociais desprezado um elemento social, não quero já dizer importante (ainda que sem receio o pudesse afirmar) mas pelo menos existente, e que durante séculos foi predominante.\\nNão há diferença na atitude sociológica de um Bossuet da atitude sociológica de qualquer livre-pensador moderno. Para um a religião domina tudo, e tudo quanto existe é subordinado a um critério religioso; para o outro a religião não importa nada, e nada do que existe depende de uma possível verdade religiosa. Qualquer dos critérios pode ser metafisicamente certo; o que se não pode negar é que qualquer deles é - e ambos da mesma maneira - sociologicamente falso. Herbert Spencer, se virmos bem, é de um dogmatismo que só não deliciaria Bossuet porque é ao contrário do dogmatismo de Bossuet.\\nQuando nós encaramos o problema religioso pelo critério sociológico, nós devemos contar (para sermos imparciais realmente) com a possibilidade, que os nossos maiores admitiam como realidade, de que o fenómeno religioso fosse especial e dominasse tudo. Porque afasta o sociólogo, sem mais pensar, esse critério do seu modo de estudar os fenómenos sociais?\\nPensa ele, bem o sabemos, que a ciência não pode admitir uma supremacia religiosa; admittir isso seria, para ele, violar a atitude da ciência. Não repara ele, porém, que, assim agindo, não fez senão substituir a ciência à religião. Ele, subordinando tudo a um critério científico, o que faz senão subordinar tudo à ciência? E em que difere esse fenómeno da subordinação de tudo à religião, que caracterizava a attitude dos nossos maiores, senão em que num caso se trata de ciência, e no outro caso se trata de religião?\\nHá na ciência qualquer princípio, qualquer fórmula determinante, que torne essencial essa subordinação? A ciência parte do princípio que tudo são factos, a religião como qualquer outro; por isso, diz ela, sem parti-pris contra a fé, mas também sem parti-pris contra ela, estuda os factos do mundo imparcialmente. Sucede, porém, que a religião é uma coisa perante a qual se não pode ser imparcial; ou se é contra ela ou a favor dela. A religião diz que é o fenómeno supremo da terra; se a ciência a colocar ao lado dos outros factos, por grande que seja o respeito com que o fizer, já vai contra ela. A religião parte do princípio que o mundo é uma soma de fenómenos, mas que acima desses fenómenos, como fenómeno diferente deles, está a religião; se a ciência, ainda que brandamente, não aceita esta subordinação de tudo à religião, já não aceita a religião; direi mais, já a ataca, por que lhe nega precisamente o que ela tem de essencial, que é o ditar-se suprema sobre todos os factos e de uma categoria diferente deles.\\nÉ facil dizer-se, e é o que lembra, que nestas condições nenhuma ciência é possível. Porque, sendo as condições essas, a ciência teria, para poder prosseguir, que começar por criticar a atitude religiosa, por discutir preliminarmente a posição da religião no mundo. Para poder trabalhar naquelas condições em que hoje de chofre trabalha, devia a ciência começar por afirmar o seu direito a fazê-lo. Isto é, a ciência deve começar por uma discussão metafísica.\\nMas, do momento que entramos no campo da especulação, passamos já, pelo próprio facto, do campo científico. Do ponto de vista metafísico, religião e ciência são duas atitudes metafísicas, a qualquer das quais não pertence, à priori, nenhuma superioridade sobre a outra. Qualquer delas quer envolver a outra, neste combate pela alma humana. A religião quer subordinar a ciência a si. A ciência quer colocar a religião no terreno dos factos. À priori, sem mais nada, a nenhuma assiste, para o que quer, mais direito do que à outra.\\nDas duas atitudes, que, vistos assim bem os factos, ficam metafisicamente com um valor igual, qual é a que presumivelmente deva dominar o espírito? Se assentámos que são duas atitudes metafísicas, não iremos empregar argumentos metafísicos sobre o assunto; porque não é esse o ponto que queremos versar, e, versado, indefinida seria a discussão.\\nQueremos apenas examinar qual seja preferível, sob o ponto de vista social, que tomemos para nosso guia. E, assim, se algum método empregamos, é um método antes científico do que outra coisa, porque buscamos apenas ver qual das duas atitudes - a científica ou a religiosa - mais nos serve como atitude social. Se são duas atitudes metafísicas, vimos, nenhuma preferência lógica pode determinar-nos seguramente por uma ou por outra. Empreguemos, pois, o único critério que nos resta, que é o da utilidade social. Terá esse uma resposta para as nossas dúvidas?\\nUm dos pontos capitais do problema deve resultar do exame comparado das actividades científica e religiosa num sentido especial. Explico melhor. Ambas essas actividades correspondem a necessidades humanas. Será, pois, segundo o critério social que vamos seguindo, superior aquela que mais liberdade deixar à outra para satisfazer os seus interesses.\\nA ciência, como se viu, integra a religião na categoria dos factos sociais; não por uma intolerância especial, mas é que a atitude científica não pode ser outra. Para isso, como vimos, ela tem inevitavelmente que atacar o princípio central da religião, que é o de que ela é superior às outras manifestações sociais, e injulgável por elas, por qualquer delas.\\nA religião deixa livre à ciência todo o campo dos fenómenos, proibindo-lhe apenas (e se o não fizesse, não seria a religião) duas ordens de coisas: que a integra, a ela religião, no domínio dos factos sociais como fenómeno; e que entre no seu domínio metafísico, discutindo os seus princípios. O segundo caso é fácil à ciência; por sua natureza ela não discute problemas metafísicos, por isso não vai criticar a religião nesse campo. O primeiro é mais difícil. Como se há-de constituir a sociologia, se se lhe levanta um obstáculo desta ordem? Quantos argumentos se façam sobre o assunto são especiosos; o facto é que neste ponto a religião limita a actividade científica. Bem sei que se pode sofismar o problema, dizendo que a religião se divide em factos sociais e factos metafísicos (por assim falar) e que são estes últimos que a ciência não pode investigar (o que aliás já se sabia). Mas uma religião é uma metafísica materializada, e não pode ser separado o seu conteúdo metafísico do seu conteúdo social, sem o que não seria uma religião, mas apenas um sistema de filosofia.\\nResulta, pois, da nossa investigação, que tanto a ciência, admitida como princípio supremo, limita a religião, como esta, assim admitida, limita aquela. Mas a ciência, admitida como princípio supremo, limita toda a religião; e a religião limita apenas uma pequena parte da ciência, que é a ciência sociológica (e, ainda assim, não é seguro que limite toda essa ciência). A esta conclusão chegamos, pois: o critério religioso é mais liberal que o critério científico, visto que, ao passo que o critério científico procura tiranizar integralmente a religião, a religião não oprime senão uma diminuta parte da ciência.\\n(Permaneceu o conflito? É certo. Mas só um indivíduo muito ignorante pode julgar que há soluções definitivas na vida, que todo o problema tem uma solução.)\\nOutro ponto de vista há a empregar no estudo deste problema. Qual dos dois fenómenos tem mais importância a dentro da sociedade e da sua vida?\\nHistoricamente, o problema não tem discussão possível. A religião data das origens da humanidade; ela sempre acompanhou a humanidade. A ciência, que, num grau pequeno e relativo, também sempre houve, pouco avultou na vida humana, pouco significou, antes da nossa época, na vida das sociedades.\\nMas se o problema historicamente se resolve assim, de que outra maneira é que se pode conceber que ele se resolva em absoluto? Não avancemos, porém; não sentenciemos, desde logo, que ela é essencial à humanidade, por isso que sempre o foi. Não admitamos tanto; a solução do problema pode fazer-se sem essa concessão ao lado religioso do argumento.\\nA ciência é, de sua natureza, um fenómeno exclusivamente intelectual. Da atitude científica exclui-se toda a emoção. Os resultados da ciência não trazem consigo, salvo num restrito sentido estético, elementos emotivos. Ora, se há coisa constatada, é que a vida humana é predominantemente emotiva. Mas isso é a vida humana em geral. Acima dessa vida emotiva, paira - arte, ciência, filosofia - a vida intelectual dos homens; neste caso vida restrita a um escol a dentro das sociedades. A ciência, sendo apenas intelectual e mesmo no parcamente emotiva que é, reflexamente emotiva ainda assim, não satisfaz senão as necessidades intelectuais dos homens. Produz assim um resultado duplamente funesto, supondo que se adopte como critério social. Duplamente funesto: não chega às massas do povo, e, a dentro do escol, não satisfaz em cada homem senão parte da sua natureza, a parte intelectual.\\nTal não acontece ao fenómeno religioso. Uma religião é ao mesmo tempo emocional e intelectual, por isso que, ao mesmo tempo que é uma dogmática e uma mitologia, é uma metafísica. Uma religião tem, de um lado, a missa, as festas, os cerimoniais seus; do outro os seus filósofos e os seus místicos. Por isso a religião dirige-se, ao mesmo tempo que à massa dos homens, ao escol entre eles. Ao mesmo tempo que satisfaz a emoção do sábio, dá-lhe repasto à sua inteligência. Como fenómeno humano, social, a religião é, pois, mais completa do que a ciência, mais equilibrada do que a ciência; mais humana do que a ciência.\\nA esta constatação outra se liga. Como conjuntos, as sociedades vivem da emoção; como indivíduos, vivem da inteligência, a capacidade de cada indivíduo para viver isolado dependendo, excluídas circunstâncias de excepção, do seu poder de pensar - seja esse pensamento o pensamento abstrato ou frio do cientista, o pensamento construtivo do poeta e do filósofo, ou o pensamento puramente emotivo do místico. Um fenómeno do género da ciência, dominando uma sociedade, desintegra-a, por isso que, não tendo carácter emocional, não pode ligar os homens, que só pela emoção se ligam. E há mais. Age sobre as massas, não eliminando-lhes a emoção, porque essa persiste sempre (porque se trata de homens e não de títeres ou abstracções), mas de uma de três maneiras, todas elas anti-sociais: diminuindo essa emoção (o que importa diminuir nas sociedades o poder de coesão de que a sua vitalidade evidentemente depende); deixando de pé só aquelas emoções em que não pode tocar (e essas são as emoções de ordem egoísta, como a estética), e estas, por existirem fracamente nas massas, tomam formas erróneas e absurdas, por isso que são de sua natureza aristocráticas, de onde resulta um abaixamento do nível não só emocional, mas também intelectual do povo, uma atribuição delle a si-próprio de atitudes mentais que não pode ter, e que em períodos sãos não procura ter, senão no seu nível, que é o religioso; e, finalmente, deixando numa liberdade maior aqueles instintos e emoções que, por fundamentais, nada pode abalar, se bem que os possa restringir e disciplinar. E daqui resulta que desaparece o freio «absurdo» da religião sobre os costumes e os instintos, e estes se desenfreiam, pois que, por «absurdo» que esse freio possa ser, o facto é que é o único que existe, porque é o único que age sobre as emoções.\\nA toda esta argumentação - que com facilidade poderia ser desdobrada em raciocínios multiplicadamente eficazes - poder-se-ia não responder, mas opor uma objecção relativa. É esta: o que acontece, então, ao amor à verdade, puro e desinteressado, do homem de ciência? o que é feito da liberdade do artista, de seguir irrestrito a sua inspiração? o que resulta para o filósofo, que queira construir o seu sistema livre do peso externo, e até interno, da fé popular e geral?\\nA esta objecção há duas respostas. A primeira é a dos factos. Nada há nas religiões que as tenha inibido de produzir grandes artistas, grandes homens de ciência, grandes filósofos. Dante não será um grande poeta? O livro de Cervantes será de um pigmeu, porque seja de uma época católica? Shakespeare resulta tacanho, porque seja católica a atitude do seu espírito, como qualquer pode ver, que queira dar-se a vê-lo? Que época produziu maiores filósofos - a nossa época, de plena liberdade de pensamento, ou aquelas em que pesava sobre os espíritos, quando não exteriormente, interiormente, o peso da religião? Com todo o respeito possível para com Comte e Spenser, eles serão, acaso, espíritos que se comparem com os antigos filósofos - Spinoza, Leibnitz. Além disso, a crítica da atmosfera religiosa produz maiores espíritos que aquela que se exerce no vácuo. Kant assim surgiu.\\nA desastrada argumentação que citaria para o caso as circunstâncias que oprimiram Galileu e Servet, esqueceria sem dúvida que estava confundindo o predomínio religioso com a falta de civilização. São dois factos que importa não confundir. Se nós víssemos que nesses tempos as penalidades criminais eram de uma suavidade enorme, que eram de uma leniência acentuada as sentenças dos juízes, e que ao mesmo tempo esses herejes aparecessem queimados, enforcados, mortos, seria então o caso de atribuir à religião uma culpa que ela efectivamente teria. Mas a religião defendia-se, como é natural, e defendia-se com as armas do tempo; com as mesmas armas com que se defendia qualquer estado. Hoje a um livro herético responde, pela brandura dos costumes do tempo, uma proibição dum bispo de que os seus diocesanos leiam; ao tempo, que era de crueldade em tudo, correspondiam os processos do tempo. Débil crítério têm, em matéria social, aqueles que não vêem estes factos.\\nA outra resposta é psicológica. Ela não faz, de resto, senão confirmar o que os factos ensinam. Nem podia deixar de assim ser. Quando se afirma que a fé prejudicará as investigações do cientista, as elocubrações do filósofo e a inspiração do poeta, fazem-se duas suposições arbitrárias: uma, que esse poeta necessariamente quererá escrever fora do âmbito dessa fé, esse filósofo explicar o universo em contradição com os princípios dessa fé, esse cientista investigar precisamente aquelas coisas que a religião proíbe, e que, vimo-lo bem, muito poucas são; outra, que esse poeta, esse filósofo, esse homem de ciência, não ousarão quebrar com esse peso religioso. Uma doutrina qualquer é grande não só pelo que produz directamente, como também pelo que produz indirectamente; tanto pelo que produz nos espíritos que domina, como nos espíritos que revolta contra si. Arguir-se-ia, talvez, que nenhuma religião pode desejar que contra ela se ergam. É certo, mas não se deve esquecer que este argumento é sociológico não religioso, que estamos estudando, não os resultados duma religião dominando todos os espíritos, o que é impossível, mas uma religião existindo normalmente, como qualquer religião do mundo.\\nA hipótese de que uma religião forçosamente será dogmática e fanática, sofre do erro de se supor que toda a religião só pode existir num período de ignorância e de fanatismo. Porque o fanatismo é anterior (socialmente falando) à religião; a religião não dá a uma sociedade um fanatismo que lá não esteja, como não há processo que arranque figos duma laranjeira.\\nMas não será assim? Não haverá incompatibilidade entre cultura e religião? É um aspecto do problema que é preciso não abandonar sem exame.\\n',\n",

Não são abstracções no sentido de serem abstractas, mas no sentido de terem apenas a realidade necessária para serem consideradas como existindo. São Chloes, Lydias e outras romanidades assim, não porque não existam, mas porque para o caso tanto vale ser Chloe como Maria Augusta, e, ao passo que esta última faz supor uma costureira, ou coisa parecida, com a agravante de o poder ser deveras, a gente sente-se realmente pagão com a Lydia.\\nNo que o Reis tem muita sorte é em escrever tão comprimidos que é quase impossível seguir com a precisa atenção - supondo que ela é precisa - o sentido completo e exacto de todos os seus dizeres. É isso que faz com que aquela ode que começa: «A flor que és, não a que dás, eu quero» (pasmem, aliás, do «eu» antes do «quero», contra toda a índole linguistica portuguesa do Ricardo Reis!) disfarce que é dirigida a um rapaz, pois poucos há (perdidos como vão na escuridão sintáctica do poeta) que reparem no pequeno «o» que define a coisa.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0«Se te colher avaro\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A mão da infausta sphynge,» etc.\\n\\nÉ a primeira vez que a sintaxe aparece como véu de pudor - delgado sendal, ou lá o que quer que seja, que cobre as partes do discurso.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'EXPLICAÇÃO DE UM LIVRO\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nEXPLICAÇÃO DE UM LIVRO \\n\\n\\nPubliquei em Outubro passado, pus à venda, propositadamente, em 1 de Dezembro, um livro de poemas, formando realmente um só poema, intitulado \\n\\nMensagem. \\n\\nFoi esse livro premiado, em condições especiais e para mim muito honrosas. pelo Secretariado de Propaganda Nacional.\\n\\n\\nA muitos que leram com apreço a \\n\\nMensagem, \\n\\nassim como a muitos que o leram ou com pouco apreço\\n\\n \\n\\nou com nenhum, certas coisas causaram perplexidade e confusão: a estrutura do livro, a disposicão nele das matérias, e mormente a mistura, que ali se encontra, de um misticismo nacionalista, ordinariamente colado, onde entre nós apareça, ao espírito e às doutrinas da Igreja de Roma, com uma religiosidade, deste ponto de vista, nitidamente herética.\\n\\n\\nUm fenómeno independente da \\n\\nMensagem, \\n\\ne posterior à sua publicação, aumentou a perplexidade de uns e outros leitores do livro. Foi esse fenómeno o meu artigo sobre \\n\\n«Associações Secretas», \\n\\ninserto no \\n\\n«Diário de Lisboa», \\n\\nde 4 de Fevereiro [1935]. Esse artigo é um ataque a um projecto de lei sobre o assunto do título, e é, correlativamente, uma defesa integral da Maçonaria, contra a qual o projecto era dirigido, e a lei hoje se dirige.\\n\\nO artigo é patentemente de um liberal, de um inimigo radical da Igreja de Roma, e de quem tem para com a Maçonaria e os maçons um sentimento profundamente fraternal.\\n\\nUm leitor atento de \\n\\nMensagem \\n\\nqualquer que fosse o conceito que formasse da valia do livro, não estranharia o anti-romanismo, constante, embora negativamente, emergente nele. Um leitor igualmente atento, mas instruído no entendimento ou ao menos na intuição das coisas herméticas, não estranharia a defesa da maçonaria em o autor de um livro tão abundantemente embebido em simbolismo templário e rosicruciano. E a este leitor seria fácil de concluir que, tendo as ordens templárias, embora não exerçam actividade política, conceitos sociais idênticos, no que positivos e no que negativos, aos da Maçonaria; e girando o rosicrucianismo, no que social, em torno de ideias de fraternidade e de paz (\\n\\nPax\\n\\n \\n\\nprofunda, frater!\\n\\n) é a saudação rosicruciana, tanto para Irmãos como para profanos), o autor de um livro assim seria forçosamente um liberal por derivação, quando o não fosse já por índole.\\n\\nMas, de facto, fui sempre fiel, por índole, e reforçada ainda por educação — a minha educação é toda inglesa —, aos princípios essenciais do liberalismo, — que são o respeito pela dignidade do Homem e pela liberdade do Espírito, ou, em outras palavras, o individualismo e a tolerância, ou, ainda, em uma só palavra, o individualismo fraternitário.\\nHá três realidades sociais — o indivíduo, a Nação, a Humanidade. Tudo mais é factício.\\nSão ficções a Família, a Religião, a Classe. É ficção o Estado. É ficção a Civilização.\\nO indivíduo, a Nação, a Humanidade são realidades porque são perfeitamente definidos. Têm contorno e forma. O indivíduo é a realidade suprema porque tem um contorno material e mental — é um corpo vivo e uma alma viva.\\n\\nA Nação é também uma realidade, pois a definem o território, ou o idioma, ou a continuidade histórica — um desses elementos, ou todos. O contorno da nação é contudo mais esbatido, mais contingente, quer geograficamente, porque nem sempre as fronteiras são as que deveriam ser; quer linguisticamente, porque largas distâncias no espaço separam países de igual\\n\\n \\n\\nidioma e que naturalmente deveriam formar uma só nação; quer historicamente, porque, por uma parte, critérios diferentes do passado nacional quebram, ou tendem para o quebrar, o vasículo nacional, e, por outra, a continuidade histórica opera diferentemente sobre camadas da população, diferentes por índole, costumes ou cultura.\\n\\n\\nA Humanidade é outra realidade social, tão forte como o indivíduo, mais forte ainda que a Nação, porque mais definida do que ela. O indivíduo é, no fundo, um conceito biológico; a Humanidade é, no fundo, um conceito zoológico — nem mais nem menos do que a espécie animal, formada de todos os indivíduos de forma humana. Uma e outra são realidades com raiz. A Nação, sendo uma realidade social, não o é material: é mais um tronco que uma raiz. O Indivíduo e a Humanidade são \\n\\nlugares, \\n\\na Nação o \\n\\ncaminho \\n\\nentre eles. É através da fraternidade patriótica, fácil de sentir a quem não seja degenerado, que gradualmente nos sublimamos, ou sublimaremos, até à fraternidade com todos os homens.\\n\\nSegue de aqui que, quanto mais intensamente formos patriotas — desde que saibamos ser patriotas —, mais intensamente nos estaremos preparando, e connosco aos que estão connosco, para um conseguimento humano futuro, que, nem que Deus o faça impossível, deveremos deixar de ter por desejável. A Nação é a escola presente para a super-Nação futura. Cumpre, porém, não esquecer que estamos ainda, e durante séculos estaremos, na escola e só na escola.\\nSer intensamente patriota é três coisas. É, primeiro, valorizar em nós o indivíduo que somos, e fazer o possível por que se valorizem os nossos compatriotas, para que assim a Nação, que é a suma viva dos indivíduos que a compõem, e não o amontoado de pedras e areia que compõem o seu território, ou a colecção de palavras separadas ou ligadas de que se forma o seu léxico ou a sua gramática — possa orgulhar-se de nós, que, porque ela nos criou, somos seus filhos, e seus pais, porque a vamos criando.

Dessa circunstância pessoal e concreta tirei a razão e a substância deste artigo impessoal e abstracto. Nada e a ninguém importa o que faz e pensa um poeta obscuro ou o defensor (um pouco menos obscuro) da Ordem Maçónica; mas alguma coisa e a todos deve importar que se distinga o que estava confundido, se aproxime o que por erro estava separado, e haja menos nevoeiro nas ideias, ainda que não seja por elas que haja de se esperar D. Sebastião.\\n\\nUma coisa, e uma só, me preocupa: que com este artigo eu contribua, em qualquer grau, para estorvar os reaccionários portugueses em um dos seus maiores e mais justos prazeres — o de dizer asneiras. Confio, porém, na solidez pétrea das suas cabeças e nas virtudes imanentes naquela fé firme e totalitária que dividem, em partes iguais, entre Nossa Senhora de Fátima e o senhor D.

       "  'text': '\\nMas a sensibilidade do nosso Ricardo Reis é estrondosamente reumática.\\nFaz festas à Musa, olhando para outro lado, pensando sei lá em quê. Não pesquisemos. E, aliás, nas festas de Ricardo Reis não há foguetes, porque a ode alcaica foi sempre uma pessoa sossegada.\\nNesta agitação interior da sensibilidade portuguesa, figuramos no texto nós dois, Caeiro e eu; o Fernando Pessoa é uma nota à margem, e o Ricardo Reis uma nota falsa.\\nDa filosofia íntima de Ricardo Reis conclui-se que ele não espera nada da vida senão vinho e morte. É simples mas um pouco frio, pois não aquecemos o vinho, como os romanos. Este contemplar calmo e quase afectivo da esperança da mortalidade absoluta tem qualquer coisa de já morto. Um ente vivo deve ao menos revoltar-se por ter que morrer, a não ser que julgue que não morre. Mas o Ricardo Reis trata a mortalidade como se fosse a imortalidade e tem uma fé simples e confiante em coisa nenhuma. Os faquirs concentravam-se fitando um ponto qualquer sem importância; mas não se poderiam concentrar se fitassem o espaço despido. O Ricardo Reis consegue este faquirismo da sensibilidade: fita o Nada, sorri, e pede vinho. De vez em quando vira-se para o outro lado e pede que o coroem de rosas. Nos intervalos vira-se para o terceiro lado e diz «Chloe». Esta Chloe, que às vezes descamba em Lydia, é pranteada na ode do Livro 1 com um adjectivo no masculino.\\nBem sei que em Caeiro há a mesma indiferença para com a morte. Mas Caeiro encara a morte como uma criança que ouviu falar dela; Ricardo Reis como um velho que a tem à porta. Nem um nem outro acredíta na imortalidade, mas Caeiro não acredita porque não pensa, e Ricardo Reis não acredita porque não acredita em nada. Por isso a leitura de Caeiro, com mortalidade e tudo, anima e estimula como o sol e o céu, que também não acreditam na imortalidade, e pela mesma razão de Caeiro; e a leitura de Ricardo Reis desanima e desconsola - a ponto de chegar a estorvar, com um estrangulamento do nosso pobre coração, a verdadeira alegria estética que nos causa. Aquilo é belo como um belo cemitério. Admiramos e saimos logo. Quanto mais belo mais nos aflije. Por baixo, por contraste com a própria beleza, sente-se, como uma presença carnal às avessas, a realidade imaginável do Nada.\\n',\n",

Por isso lhes não marcámos, na face, um período de publicação. Como sem pensar se compreende, essa irregularidade é efeito não só de contrariedades materiais que é de crer que surjam, senão também de nenhum dos colaboradores julgar da dignidade do seu pensamento apressar-se para dar à leitura seus escritos em (determinada) data. Mais esta, do que a outra, consideração, nos leva a não dar um tom periódico a esta publicação. Nas vésperas, por assim dizer, da saída dos números teremos cura em que não falte aviso, para que não escape aos que, porventura, se disponham a acompanhar-nos, com agrado ou simples curiosidade, no nosso caminho para o Olimpo.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\n\\nOc.\\n\\n\\nBut the real meaning of initiation is that this visible world we live in is a symbol and a shadow, that this life we know through the senses is a death and a sleep, or, in other words, that what we see is an illusion. Initiation is the dispelling — a gradual, partial dispelling — of that illusion. The reason for its secret is that most men are not adapted to understand it and will therefore misunderstand and confuse it if it be made public. The reason for its being symbolic is that initiation is not a knowledge but a life, and that man must therefore think out for himself what the symbols show, for thus he will live their life and not only learn the words in which they are shown.\\n\\nTo say that Xt. is a symbol of the sun is to put the initiatory process the wrong way about. It is the sun that is the symbol of Xt. In other words, Xt. is the reality and the sun the illusion, Xt. the light and the sun the shadow. (The Ineffable is light, the GA body, the world shadow —the shadow cast by the dense when lit by the subtle. The light is in the circumference (?) and the shadow cast into the centre (?) — Has this anything to do with the pt. within the c.?) (Cf. the kabbalistic idea of En Soph drawing inwards, manifesting in and not out).\\n\\nTo initiate a man by a complicated and more or less impressive ritual and then confide to him, under pledges of secrecy and oaths more or less terrible, that spring comes after winter—this could never have been the device of any initiatory body or system. Rather will it have been to teach him the contrary — that spring following winter is a symbol of greater things, that the natural is a figurement of the supernatural.\\n\\nThis, carried to more or less detail, in symbol, then in doctrine, then in revelation, is the essence of all real initiations, from Eleusis to Kilwinning.\\n\\nOrders of init: (l) through symbols and (later) explanations in themselves symbolic — cf. Pike; (2) through symbolic doctrine, true on its level, and explanations no longer symbolic; (3) through direct though not necessarily spoken or uttered communication.\\n\\nI do not say that these things represent a truth and I do not say that they do not. I say that this is the meaning of initiation, that it is thus that initiation exists and that it is for those purposes that it exists.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'The paths of Mysticism and of Magic...\\n',\n",
       "  'text': \"\\n\\nInitiation\\n\\n\\nThe paths of Mysticism and of Magic are often paths of delusion and of error. Mysticism means essentially trust in intuition; Magic means essentially trust in power. Intuition is an operation of the mind by which the results of intelligence are obtained without the use of intelligence. Power, in the sense of magical power, is an operation of the mind by which the results of continuous effort are obtained without the use of continuous effort. Both, however long they may take to operate, are short cuts to knowledge.\\n\\nIn a certain sense both Mysticism and Magic are confessions of impotence. The Mystic is a man who feels that he has not the strength of thinking in him to get to truth by thinking. The Magician is a man who feels he has not the strength of will in him to get to truth (or to power) by strength of will. The idle girl who guesses things, or guesses at things, is a mystic within her shallow province; she is too lazy to try to know. The peasant woman who tries to keep her husband's love by charms and potions is a magician within her garret-frontiers; she is too ignorant and too weak to strive to do so by direct charm, by persistent seduction. In both cases there is an evasion.\\n\\nThis does not mean — or, at least, it needs not mean — that the results of Mysticism or of Magic are necessarily wrong. It does mean, however, that there is no criterion by which we can distinguish a wrong from a right result in one path or the other. In the Gnosis, where we employ intellect, we have at least the ballast of reasoning; we can at least compare one «result» with another, examine whether they be contradictory either each within itself, or one in respect of the other. We may not reason well, but we do reason. If we go wrong it is because we go wrong and not because we are wrong, as in the other two paths. It is like adding up wrong, where the mistake is not in adding but in not adding well; adding is, nevertheless, the right system to get a total.\\n\\nThis will be clear if we take simple, we might say current, examples of mysticism and of magic. A simple case of mysticism is the common type of intuition that is called «a hunch» in vulgar speech. A man has a hunch that a certain number will have the first prize in a lottery. Now and again the hunch comes out right, but we all know that for every time it comes out right there are thousands it comes out wrong. If it were not so, a gambling club would not be the great business proposition it always is. In this case, indeed, there is an easy way to check the rightness of the hunch: the lottery, once drawn, will show. But how is the mystic's hunch that he has attained unity with Christ to be proved or disproved? He says he knows, he feels... But the madman who thinks himself Christ or the king of some country is as sure of that as the mystic of his intuition.\\n\\nTake, again, a simple case of magic — spiritism. Spiritism is magic because it is evocation of the  spirits of the dead to this life. A séance is made, the spirit of the departed X is evoked, the voice of the medium, the three-legged table or the planchette announces that it has appeared. How do we know that it has? The communication of things known only to one present may be a projection of the mind of that one present. The communication of things known only to the dead man, and afterwards verified, may be a communication from some force, or even spirit, other than the dead man's. And when the spirit gives information of its present abode, by what method do we ascertain if that information is right or wrong? I do not say that all that emerges in a séance or has emerged in séances is wrong; neither do I say that it is right: I say that there is no means of knowing the origin of the information thus received and where the information is concerning other worlds, or things otherwise unverifiable here, no means of knowing either its origin or its truth.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'O PRECONCEITO DA ORDEM\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nO PRECONCEITO DA ORDEM\\n\\n\\nEntre os vários preconceitos que salpicam as teses dos neo-monárquicos avulta, como grande mancha, o preconceito comtista da Ordem.\\nEvidentemente que por \"ordem\" os seus defensores não entendem a mera ordem material e ostensiva, aquela que a polícia guarda. Entendem a ordem nos espíritos também, a disciplina íntima de onde resulta o bom funcionamento, físico como psíquico, da engrenagem social. Eles compreendem, de resto, que não há ordem só material, que é nos espíritos que a ordem começa.\\nPosto isto, porém, há ainda a reparar que o conceito de ordem pode ser tomado em dois sentidos, consoante se entenda que ela existe, ou essencialmente na própria íntima constituição das forças sociais, ou essencialmente apenas no modo de essas forças se manifestarem.\\n\\nSe se entende que a ordem existe tanto mais perfeitamente quanto mais perfeita conformidade básica há nos ânimos, quanto mais íntima e real a submissão à orientação geral da sociedade em que se vive, chega-se, como conclusão rigorosa, a este resultado: que o ideal social dos defensores da ordem é uma sociedade absolutamente nivelada, de onde não possam emergir valores nem aristocracias. Porque esses valores e aristocracias ou hão-de agir no sentido da orientação geral dessa sociedade, ou em sentido contrário. Se agem em sentido contrário, são, perante o conceito da ordem que examinamos, criadores de anarquia e de dissolução. E se agem no sentido da orientação social, ou agem criando-a, ou representando-a. Se agem criando-a, pressupõe-se que a maioria dessa sociedade é uma massa inerte e morta, incapaz de esboçar uma orientação social — e, nesse caso, como puderam surgir esses valores e aristocracias, e o poder criador que se lhes supõe? como, se a sociedade onde, por hipótese, existem é uma sociedade onde, pela mesma hipótese, não poderiam existir? A hipótese só é admissível se essa \"aristocracia\" for de estrangeiros: mas não é, por certo, uma \"ordem\" imposta por estrangeiros que os nacionalistas querem defender. Se, por outra, esses valores e aristocracias não criam, mas simplesmente representam e \\n\\ndirigem \\n\\numa orientação social geral, teremos este absurdo: individualidades superiores, e portanto acentuadas, que só pensam em se subordinar e se apagar; dirigentes e mandantes com a mentalidade típica dos mandados e dos dirigidos. A este repugnante igualitarismo nos arrasta o conceito da ordem, na primeira das suas duas formas possíveis.\\n\\nMas não é esta, porventura, a \"ordem\" que os neo-monárquicos cantam. É no segundo dos dois sentidos apontados que tomam a palavra. A ordem existirá, portanto, não numa servil uniformização das orientações sociais, mas numa preocupação em que as manifestações delas sejam ordeiras. Isto é, cada partido político deve incluir, tácita ou expressamente, a preocupação da ordem no seu programa.\\nMediram bem os neo-monárquicos as consequências sociais terríveis que resultariam de tal orientação?\\nRepare-se em que iríamos cair. Um partido político qualquer teria, além da preocupação das teorias políticas que o fazem tal, a preocupação da ordem. Tem de ter as duas preocupações com igual intensidade. Porque se está pronto a sacrificar a ordem à realização das suas teorias políticas, não tem, realmente, a preocupação da ordem. E se está pronto a sacrificar à ordem as suas teorias políticas, não é propriamente um partido político; pois que, tendo tais teorias, têm-nas por certo por essenciais à Pátria ou à Humanidade, e não vai sacrificar a Pátria ou a Humanidade à Ordem, que, em qualquer hipótese, só pode ter valor secundariamente à Humanidade ou à Pátria. Mas, se um partido político tem com igual intensidade determinadas teorias e a preocupação da ordem, ele, porque tem tais teorias e não outras, é fatalmente levado a crer que a verdadeira realização da ordem só pode ser obtida pela verdadeira realização dessas teorias. Porque não é de supor que um partido, que se preocupe com a ordem, julgue que os seus princípios partidários estão em desacordo com ela; nesse caso, ou não existia, ou seria um outro partido. Segue que a preocupação da ordem dará a um partido político uma vontade de dominar e de se impor absolutamente violenta, visto que é sentido como impreterivelmente necessário, para a manutenção da ordem, o seu domínio, o domínio dos princípios que representa. Donde se conclui que a preocupação da ordem, num partido político, eleva ao rubro as suas paixões; e que, portanto, num país onde todos os partidos tenham a constante preocupação da ordem, se estará em constante desordem e anarquia. É este, mesmo, o único modo de se chegar ao estado de anarquia social. Esse estado provém da excessiva preocupação da ordem.\\nQueda assim feito em farrapos o preconceito da ordem, roto por todos os lados o papel em que os neo-monárquicos embrulham as suas teorias de contrabando. Mas isto, com certeza, embora oriente, não satisfará o leitor. Ele quererá saber, sem dúvida, qual seja, sobre este ponto, a verdadeira noção sociológica. É fácil fazer-lha ver.\\n\\nA ordem é nas sociedades o que a saúde é no indivíduo. Não é uma coisa: é um \\n\\nestado. Resulta \\n\\ndo bom funcionamento do organismo, mas não é esse bom funcionamento. O homem normal só pensa na saúde quando está doente. Do mesmo modo, a sociedade normal só pensa na ordem quando nela aparece a desordem. O homem normal quando adoece, procura, não simplesmente sentir-se outra vez de saúde, mas atacar a doença; afastada ela, do seu afastamento resultará a saúde. De nada lhe serviria sentir-se de saúde, se essa sensação não proviesse do afastamento definitivo da doença, mas apenas da sua intermitência ou de uma anestesia qualquer. Na sociedade, semelhantemente: quando aparece a desordem, a sociedade sã procura logo. não manter a ordem, que pode ser provisória ou aparente, mas atacar o mal que produziu a desordem. A exclusiva preocupação da ordem é um morfinismo social.\\n\\nLevemos até ao fim esta justíssima analogia. No indivíduo, a constante preocupação da saúde é um sintoma de neurastenia, ou de males psíquicos mais graves ainda. Na sociedade, paralelamente, a preocupação da ordem, é uma doença de espírito colectivo. Se os argumentos que acima expus não bastaram para insinuar esta conclusão no ânimo do leitor, ele pode verificar de todo a hipótese, reportando-se às circunstâncias sociais em que nasceu a moderna preocupação da ordem, e à espécie de cérebro onde ela surgiu definidamente.\\nApareceu ela num período perturbado e anormal da política francesa e em plena vigência da doença chamada romantismo. É, caracterizadamente, uma ideia romântica.\\nO seu criador filosófico, o infeliz chamado Augusto Comte, toda a vida sofreu de alienação mental.\\n',\n",

If we assume that, whatsoever may have been (apart from the falseness of using a tense, which implies time) the manner of God's creation of the world, the substance of that creation was the conversion by God of His own consciousness into the plural consciousness of separate beings The great cry of the Indian Deity, «Oh that I might be many!» gives the idea without the idea of reality.\\n\\nUnion with God means therefore the repetition by the Adept of the Divine Act of Creation, by which he is identical with God in act, or manner of act, but, at the same time, an inversion of the Divine Act, by which he is still divided from God, or God's opposite, else he were God Himself and no union were required.\\n\\nThe Adept, if he succeed in making his consciousness one with the consciousness of all things, in making it an unconsciousness (or unselfconsciousness} which is conscious, repeats within himself the Divine Act, which is the conversion of God's individual consciousness into God's plural consciousness in individuals. But, at the same time, he thus reaches back to the plurality God attained when making that whole of which he is a part, and, in repeating God's Act, he is really inverting it, and, in inverting it, going back on the way to God, and thus attaining union with God.\\n\\nIf we represent the whole scheme of this by two equilateral triangles on the same base, each, so to speak, opposite to the other, we shall obtain a clear idea, or an idea as clear as possible, of the method of attainment. God, apex of the upper triangle, opens out into the base, and the base narrows down into the castdown apex of the lower triangle.  From the apex of the lower triangle there is ascent into the base-line of both: thus the descent of God is repeated upwards, and, at the same time, there is ascent towards God.\\n\\nNow this, whichever way it be considered, leads us to the peculiar theory of three types of consciousness: the Divine Consciousness, the World Consciousness, and the Individual Consciousness. In the first identity is absolute, there being neither subject nor object. In the second the subject has made itself its own object, and, being infinite because indivisible, becomes objectively infinite, that is infinite because infinitely divisible. In the third the subject has made itself as object its own subject, and has taken consciousness of itself, and therefore consciousness of itself in every infinitesimal element of that object.\\n\\nThe more each infinitesimal subject makes itself an object unto itself, the more it approaches the first back-step to the Supreme Consciousness. From this it will eventually pass to annulling this, and going back to the primal stage of Divine consciousness.\\n\",\n",

       "  'text': '\\n\\nInitiation \\n\\n\\nHow, then, is a man who seeks «initiation» to train himself for it? How, in other words, is he to take within himself the Neophyte Grades of the Inner Order? He should begin by making himself acquainted with philosophical systems and with such philosophy as emerges, rightly or wrongly, from the more recent acquisitions of science. Once thus grounded, he should reflect and compare, putting system against system, theory against theory, and part of each system against other parts. He will thus develop his abstract intelligence, without which the intuition he seeks to develop will be no more than emotion.\\n\\nHe should begin by stripping himself of all dogmatic prejudices, of all things that have been put  into his mind by education and custom. The path of initiation cannot be reached through the portals of any of the churches, but either through the portals of all at the same time, or by the portals of none. He should next make himself acquainted with religious systems of all kinds, with philosophic systems and ......(ut supra).\\n\\nHe should then elaborate, as well as he can, a system of his own, build up slowly, out of what he has learnt, and not necessarily writing it, a system, as coherent as he can make it, of the interpretation of the universe in the triple lines of truth, beauty and conduct.\\n\\nHe will then proceed to abandon the system he has formed. He will have come to love it, but it is now for him to reflect, that it is not worth more than the other philosophic systems, which has compared among themselves, and, since he has established his own system, rejected.\\n\\nHe will thus have traversed the four stages which are the temptation of the World — Dogma, Concrete Intelligence or Science, Abstract Intelligence or Philosophy, and Critical Intelligence.\\n\\nDogma, by which he is tied to others; Science, by which he is tied to Nature; Philosophy, by which he is tied to the minds of others; his own philosophy, by which he is tied to himself. For the World is all these. Once he has passed these four stages of the Neophyte stage, he is ready for initiation. It lies then with him to choose on which path he shall make it — if on the mystical, the magical or the gnostic path. It is juster to say the path on which he shall begin to make it, for the full initiation in the Adept Stage includes all three. In the first Adept Grade he will take the one path he has chosen and complete his way in it; in the second Adept Grade he will take one of the other two paths; in the third Adept Grade he will take the one that remains.\\n\\nHe has to conquer the three temptations which are under the Flesh — lusts, which are conquered by mysticism; indecisions, which are conquered by magic; delusions, which are conquered by the gnosis. He has to conquer\\n\\nIt will be said that this makes initiation X very difficult task. It makes it because so it is. Why should initiation be easy? It will be said that only a man of special intelligence can take the neophyte grades, since to be grounded in philosophy the capacity for abstract reasoning is required, and not all men possess it. But why should all men be fit for initiation? If it be said that that is unjust we may reply, either that why should the universe be just? which is perhaps a wrong, but is certainly a sufficient, reply; or that the question is put on the assumption that there is no development in the world, otherwise that the man is ended in one span of earthly life, and that it is possible that reincarnation be true, when there is no injustice but only degrees, as in outer life itself there are degrees in strength, beauty, intelligence and the like.\\n\\nA man can at least yearn for initiation, and, if abstract intelligence is the first stage in the path and he has not abstract intelligence, he can at least yearn for it; it costs him as much, or as little to yearn for intelligence as for initiation, and he is really yearning for the same thing in the proper order when he yearns for intelligence.\\n(The mystic without intelligence has not attained the first Adept Grade: he has no more than attained the intergrade between the Neophyte and the Adept Grades, the blank purgatory of wrong ascent).\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'There were three reasons why, in the pagan religions,\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nthe essay on INITIATION \\n\\nThere were three reasons why, in the pagan religions, certain truths, or things thought to be truths, were delivered only in secrecy and apartness, by initiation. The first reason was a social one: it was thought that those certain truths were unfit for delivery to any man, unless he was in a certain measure prepared to receive, and that they would have disastrous social effects if they were made public, for that would mean that they would be misunderstood. «Etiamsi revelare destruere est...» The second reason was a philosophic one: it was thought that, in themselves, such truths were not of a kind that the common man could understand, and that mental confusion and therefore unbalance in conduct would result from their being uselessly communicated to him. The third reason was, so to speak, a spiritual one: it was thought that such truths, being truths of the inner life, should not be communicated but suggested, and that the suggestion should be impressive, it had to be girt round with secrecy, that it might be felt to be valuable, with ritual, that it might impress and astonish, with symbols, that the candidate be forced to work out his own way, by striving to interpret the symbols, instead of thinking himself full of knowledge, if communication had been made by dogmatic or philosophic teaching.\\n\\nI do not say that these three reasons stood clear, either severally or together yet divided thus, in the minds of the ancients, priests or laymen of their religions. But I do say that, if not by direct intelligence, then at least by intuition, they based their religions on this divisional scheme.\\n\\nThe religions of the ancients, and preeminently so the pagan religions of Greece and Rome, which are those that most concern us, since our minds are their children, were divided into three forms. There was a social form, the cultus, which was of the man as citizen. There was an individual form, the poetry, which was of the man as non-citizen; the cultus duly fulfilled, he could interpret to himself the gods as he chose and elaborate their legends as he best thought fit. And there was a secret form, initiation, which participated in secrecy of the characteristics of both: it was individual, because (even when initiation is collective, as it was in the great pagan Mysteries) it is always the individual who is initiated and not the group; it was social, because initiation was communicated in ritual and ritual is social.\\n\\nWhich with the Christians is rarely linked or fused with poetry as it was with the pagans. (We will not understand the middle ages until we understand that theology was their poetry, that the lack of poetry then was but the presence of poetry under another form).\\n\\nAll religions, however, are in the same state as the great pagan religions. The three forms of religion will be found, one way or another, in all. In the Christian religions, for instance, we have the public cult, be it highly ceremonial, as in the Roman Church, or poor to nakedness, as in the extreme Protestant dissensions; we have the individual religion, meaning the personal reflection on the dogmas and formulae of faith, and this is theology where (with the pagans) it was rather poetry; and we have the inner life of the Christian, which is his initiation, for in the Christian religions initiation is considered as given by Christ alone mystically, not by any priest or hierophant ritually or ceremonially. In other words — the exacter meaning of which will be understood later —, pagan initiation moved towards Magic, as all ritual initiations do, Christian initiation moved towards Mysticism, as do all meditative initiations; it will also be seen later that there is a third type of initiation.\\n\\nWhatever be the number of grades, outward or inward, in the scale of ascent towards Truth, they may be considered as three — Neophyte, Adept and Master. In reality the grades are ten — four under Neophyte, three under Adept and three (so to speak) under Master. There are really five under Neophyte, but the first grade is not numbered. There are also two intergrades, falling between the first and second, and the second and third orders, and these are unnumbered too. The unnumbered grades are grades of probation whereas the others are, each within its measure, grades of attainment.\\n\\nThe Neophyte, throughout the grades which this expression describes, is essentially a learner; his way is towards the completion of knowledge in the outer sphere. In the Adept, throughout his three steps, there is a progress in the unifying of knowledge with life. In the Master there is, or is said to be, a destruction of the unity thus attained in virtue of a higher unity. \\nA comparison with simpler things will, I think, render this clear. Let us suppose that the writing of great poetry is the end of initiation. The Neophyte stage will be the acquisition of the cultural elements which the poet will have to deal with in writing poetry — being,  grade by grade and in what seems to me to be an exact analogy: (0) grammar, (l) general culture, (2) particular literary culture, (3) The Adept stage will be, drawing out the analogy in the same manner: (4) the writing of simple lyrical poetry, as in a common lyric, (5) the writing of complex lyrical poetry, as in (7) the writing of ordered or philosophical lyrical poetry, as in the ode.\\nThe Master stage will be, in the same manner: (8) the writing of epic poetry, (9) the writing of dramatic poetry, (l0) the fusing of all poetry, lyric, epic and dramatic, into something beyond all these.\\n\\nThree remarks will occur to the reader of this literary analogy. The first is that one can be a poet without the Neophyte grades, an Adept of the first Adept grade without even «taking» the first Neophyte one. The second is that, the progression stated throughout does not correspond to what usually happens in life, be it that of a poet or of any other man. The third is that a fusing of all poetry, lyric, epic dramatic, into something beyond all three is an attainment passing understanding.\\n\\nI have made the reader make these remarks that I may, by replying to them, complete the analogy with an explanation. As to the first remark. The first Adept grade is indeed the first real grade of real initiation. A simple mystic, who fuses his faith and his life, has attained to the beginning of real initiation, whereas the perfected neophyte, in whom faith (or knowledge) and life are still separate, has not attained it. But if the spontaneous Adept has reached the Fifth Grade without having passed the first five (which include the Zero grade) he will be kept standing for a long time at the entry of the Middle Chamber, where the first grade of adeptship may conveniently be said to be «placed».

       "  'text': '\\nMeu querido José Pacheco:\\n\\nVenho escrever-lhe para o felicitar pela sua «Contemporânea» para lhe dizer que não tenho escrito nada e para por alguns embargos ao artigo do Fernando Pessoa.\\nQuereria mandar-lhe também colaboração. Mas, como lhe disse, não escrevo. Fui em tempos poeta decadente; hoje creio que estou decadente, e já o não sou.\\nIsto de mim, que é quem mais próximo está de mim, apesar de tudo. De si e de sua revista, tenho saudades do nosso «Orpheu» ! V . continua sub-repticiamente, e ainda bem . Estamos, afinal, todos no mesmo lugar. Parece que variamos só com a oscilação de quem se equilibra. Repito-lhe que o felicito. Julgava difícil fazer tanto bem aos olhos em Portugal com uma coisa impressa. Julgo bom que julgasse mal. Auguro à «Contemporânea» o futuro que lhe desejo.\\nAgora o artigo do Fernando. Com o intervalo entre a primeira palavra desta carta e a primeira palavra deste parágrafo, já quase me não lembra o que é que lhe queria dizer do artigo. Talvez pensasse em dizer exactamente o que vou escrever a seguir. Enfim, prometi, e digo o que sinto agora, e segundo os nervos deste momento.\\nContinua o Fernando Pessoa com aquela mania, que tantas vezes lhe censurei, de julgar que as coisas se provam. Nada se prova senão para ter a hipocrisia de não afirmar. O raciocínio é uma timidez — duas timidezes talvez, sendo a segunda a de ter vergonha de estar calado.\\nIdeal estético, meu querido José Pacheco, ideal estético! Onde foi essa frase buscar sentido? E o que encontrou lá quando o descobriu? Não há ideias nem estéticas senão nas ilusões que nós fazemos deles. O ideal é um mito da acção, um estimulante como o ópio ou a cocaína: serve para sermos outros, mas paga-se caro — com o nem sermos quem poderíamos ter sido.\\nEstética, José Pacheco? Não há beleza, como não há moral, como não há fórmulas senão para definir compostos. Na tragédia físico-química a que se chama a Vida, essas coisas são como chamas — simples sinais de combustão.\\nA beleza começou por ser uma explicação que a sexualidade deu a si-própria de preferências provavelmente de origem magnética. Tudo é um jogo de forças, e na obra da arte não temos que procurar «beleza» ou coisa que possa andar no gozo desse nome. Em toda a obra humana, ou não humana, procuramos só duas coisas, força e equilíbrio de força — energia e harmonia, se V. quiser.\\nPerante qualquer obra de qualquer arte — desde a de guardar porcos à de construir sinfonias — pergunto só: quanta força? quanta mais força? quanta violência de tendência? quanta violência reflexa de tendência, violência de tendência sobre si própria, força da força em não se desviar da sua direcção, que é um elemento da sua força?\\nO resto é o mito das Danaides, ou outro qualquer mito — porque todo o mito é o das Danaides, e todo o pensamento (diga-o ao Fernando) enche eternamente um tonel eternamente vazio.\\nLi o livro do Botto e gosto dele. Gosto dele porque a arte do Botto é o contrário da minha. Se eu gostasse só da minha arte, nem da minha arte gostava, porque vario.\\nE, à parte gostar, porque gosto? É sempre mau perguntar, porque pode haver resposta. Mas pergunto — porque gosto? Há força, há equilíbrio de força, nas «Canções»?\\nLouvo nas «Canções» a força que lhes encontro. Essa força não vejo que tenha que ver com ideais nem com estéticas. Tem que ver com imoralidade. É a imoralidade absoluta, despida de dúvidas. Assim há direcção absoluta — força portanto; e há harmonia em não admitir condições a essa imoralidade. O Botto tende com uma energia tenaz para todo o imoral; e tem a harmonia de não tender para mais coisa alguma. Acho inútil meter os gregos no caso; grego se veria o Fernando com eles se eles lhe aparecessem a pedir-lhe contas do sarilho de estéticas em que os meteu. Os gregos eram lá estetas! Os gregos existiram.\\nA arte do Botto é integralmente imoral. Não há célula nela que esteja decente. E isso é uma força porque é uma não hipocrisia, uma não complicação. Wilde tergiversava constantemente. Baudelaire formulou uma tese moral da imoralidade; disse que o mau era bom por ser mau, e assim lhe chamou bom. O Botto é mais forte: dá à sua imoralidade razões puramente imorais, porque não lhe dá nenhumas.\\nO Botto tem isto de forte e de firme: é que não dá desculpas. E eu acho, e deverei talvez sempre achar, que não dar desculpas é melhor que ter razão.\\nNão lhe digo mais. Se continuasse, contradizer-me-ia. Seria abominável, porque talvez fosse uma maneira (a inversa) de ser lógico. Quem sabe?\\nRelembro saudosamente — aqui do Norte improfícuo — os nossos tempos do «Orpheu», a antiga camaradagem, tudo em Lisboa de que eu gostava, e tudo em Lisboa de que eu não gostava — tudo com a mesma saudade.\\nSaudo-o em Distância Constelada. Esta carta leva-lhe a minha afeição pela sua revista; não lhe leva a minha amizade por si porque V. já há muito tempo aí a tem. \\nDiga ao Fernando Pessoa que não tenha razão. \\nUm abraço do camarada amigo\\n\\nÁLVARO DE CAMPOS\\n\\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, 17 Outubro 1922.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nSendo certo — para VV. Ex.as como para mim — que a vida da nacionalidade é a substância dinâmica da vida da civilização, não podemos, porém, concordar quando se trate de determinar o que seja essa vida das nacionalidades.\\nHá três espécies de nacionalismo:\\n\\n(1) Há o nacionalismo tradicionalista, que é o que faz consistir a substância da nacionalidade em qualquer ponto do seu passado, e a vitalidade nacional na continuidade histórica com esse ponto do passado. Diversos são os critérios com que se pode buscar esse ponto do passado, mas, seja qual for o critério que se emprega, a essência do \\n\\nprocessus \\n\\né a mesma.\\n\\n2) Há o nacionalismo integral, que consiste em atribuir a uma nação determinados atributos psíquicos, na permanência dos quais e fidelidade social aos quais, reside a vitalidade e a consistência da nacionalidade. O nacionalismo integral — por exemplo, Teixeira de Pascoaes — não se apoia na tradição, mas em um psiquismo colectivo concebido como determinado, em que essa tradição ou, tida como valendo, se apoia, ou, dada como sem valor permanente, se apoiou para existir,\\n(3) Há finalmente o nacionalismo sintético, que consiste em atribuir a uma nacionalidade, como princípio de individuação, não uma tradição determinada, nem um psiquismo determinadamente tal, mas um modo especial de sintetizar as influências do jogo civilizacional.\\nO Integralismo Lusitano é um nacionalismo tradicionalista.\\nO saudosismo de Teixeira de Pascoaes é um nacionalismo integral. Busca no passado a manifestação da alma nacional (suposta existente).\\nOutro, e diferente do de qualquer dos outros, é o processo adoptado pelo nacionalismo sintético. Para ele não há propriamente uma alma nacional; há apenas uma direcção nacional. Uma nação tem apenas, dados os factores inalienáveis de situação geográfica, um determinado papel no conjunto das nações, de que é formada uma civilização.\\nO nacionalista tradicionalista repele o presente e o estrangeiro. O nacionalista integral repele o estrangeiro. O nacionalista sintético aceita um e outro, buscando imprimir o cunho nacional não na matéria, mas na forma, da obra.\\nQual tem razão? Cada um a tem em seu campo, mas o nacionalista integral é que a tem supremamente, porque só ele está em todos os campos ao mesmo tempo.\\n(Dentro desse papel cabem modalidades muito diversas de psiquismo nacional.)\\nO papel de uma nação forte e civilizada é imprimir um cunho seu aos elementos civilizacionais comuns a todas as nações do seu tempo.\\n\\nTem-se confundido a influência de uma nação estrangeira com a influência de muitas. O conflito cultural é que produz civilização. Estamos estagnados porque somos escravos — temos sido escravos de uma nação estrangeira \\n\\nde cada vez\\n\\n. Se tivéssemos recebido de cada vez correntes várias do estrangeiro ter-nos-íamos libertado. É preciso não eliminar a cultura francesa que nos escraviza, mas acrescentar-lhe outra cultura, em conflito com ela — cultura alemã ou inglesa pouco importa.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nSubsolo (or the like).\\n\\nAfinal o conteúdo dos mistérios resume-se em ensinamentos, sobre três ordens de coisas, que sempre se julgou que não devem ser reveladas ao geral dos homens. Sempre se julgou que aqueles ensinamentos, que as religiões ministram, deveriam ser adaptados à mente dos que a os recebem, e, como muitos deles — tal é a opinião dos iniciados — são de ordem que o povo em geral os não compreenderia e que portanto, compreendendo os pervertidamente, se perturbaria com ele, segue que se pensou que esses ensinamentos se deveriam dividir em duas ordens: exotéricos ou profanos os que são expostos de modo a que todos possam ser ministrados; esotéricos ou ocultos os que, sendo mais verdadeiros, ou inteiramente verdadeiros, não convém que se ministrem senão a indivíduos previamente preparados, gradualmente preparados, para os receber. A esta preparação se chamava, e chama, iniciação. E esta iniciação é ela mesma gradual em todos os mistérios, e de tal modo disposta que o indivíduo inapto para receber esses ensinamentos ocultos se revela tal antes que eles lhe sejam inteiramente dados.\\n\\nSe esses ensinamentos ocultos são verdadeiros, ou apenas especulações abstrusas, é outro problema. Se os hierofantes do oculto têm, na verdade, maior conhecimento da verdade pura do que nós profanos, que a buscamos, se a buscamos, com a leitura; ou a meditação, ou a inteligência discursiva e dialéctica — não o podemos nós saber. Tudo isso pode ser sinceramente crido pelos iniciados, e ser falso. O oculto pode ter alucinações próprias, enganos seus.\\n\\nSeja como for, o certo é que os ensinamentos ministrados nos mistérios abrangem três ordens de coisas: (1) a verdadeira natureza da alma humana, da vida e da morte, (2) a verdadeira maneira de entrar em contacto com as forças secretas da natureza e manipulá-las, e (3) a verdadeira natureza de Deus ou dos Deuses e da criação do mundo. São, respectivamente, o segredo alquímico, o segredo mágico, e o segredo místico. Ao primeiro chama se alquímico porque os ensinamentos relativos a ele são em geral ministrados através de símbolos da chamada alquimia, que não é mais, como hoje claramente se sabe, do que uma linguagem simbólica.\\n',\n",

É o sentido, com que os aparelhos se empregam, e com que as operações são feitas, que estabelece a diferença entre a química e a alquimia.\\nA matéria do mundo físico é constituída de três modos, todos eles simultaneamente reais: só dois desses modos interessam a um nível conceitual diferente, e não é atingível por operações, aparelhos ou processos que sequer se parecem com os que se empregam em qualquer cousa que se chame «química» ou «física» «ocultas» ou não.\\nA matéria é na verdade, e como crêem o físico e o químico normais, constituída por um sistema de forças em equilíbrio instável, formando corpos dinâmicos a que se pode chamar «átomos» Porque isto é real, e a matéria, considerada fisicamente, é na verdade assim constituída, são possíveis as experiências e os resultados dos homens de ciência, e a matéria é manipulável por meios materiais, por processos apenas físicos ou químicos, e para fins tangíveis e imediatamente reais.\\nMas, ao mesmo tempo, os elementos que compõem a matéria têm um outro sentido: existem não só como matéria, mas também como símbolo. Há, por exemplo, um ferro-matéria; há, porém, e ao mesmo tempo, o mesmo ferro, um ferro-símbolo. Cada elemento simboliza determinada linha de força supermaterial e pode, portanto, ser realizada sobre ele uma operação, ou acção, que o atinja e o altere, não só no que elemento, mas também no que símbolo. E, feita essa operação, o efeito produzido excede trancendentalmente o efeito material que fica visível, sensível, mensurável no vaso ou aparelho em que a experiência se realizou.\\nÉ esta a operação alquímica.\\nE isto no seu aspecto externo: porque, na sua realidade intima, é mais alguma cousa do que isto. Como o físico (incluindo no termo o químico também), ao operar materialmente sobre a matéria, visa a transformar a matéria e a dominá-la, para fins materiais; assim o alquímico, ao operar materialmente quanto aos processos mas transcendentemente quanto às operações, sobre a matéria, visa a transformar o que a matéria simboliza, e a dominar o que a matéria simboliza, para fins que não são materiais.\\n\\nA semelhança, porém, pára aqui. O resultado da experiência física é um produto externo, com que o operador não tem nada, excepto vê-lo, ou ser dono dele, se o é. Mas na experiência alquímica a «força», que o corpo trabalhado simboliza, está em contacto directo com o espírito do operador, e não só do operador, como também de quantos \\n\\nconscientemente\\n\\n o auxiliam (embora sem conhecimento alquímico) na suas experiências. O resultado da experiência, portanto, afecta o operador e os seus «adjuntos» (como se diz) de uma forma diversa e diversamente importante.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\nO QUE É A METAFÍSICA?\\n\\nNa opinião de Fernando Pessoa, expressa no ensaio «Athena», a filosofia — isto é, a metafísica — não é uma ciência, mas uma arte. Não creio que assim seja. Parece-me que Fernando Pessoa confunde o que a arte é com o que a ciência não é. Ora o que não é ciência, nem por isso é necessariamente arte: é simplesmente não-ciência. Pensa Fernando Pessoa, naturalmente que como a metafísica não chega, nem aparentemente pode chegar, a uma conclusão verificável, não é uma ciência. Esquece que o que define uma actividade é o seu fim; e o fim da metafísica é idêntico ao da ciência — conhecer factos, e não ao da arte — substituir factos. As ciências realizam esse fim de conhecer factos — realizam-no umas mais, outras menos- — porque os factos que pretendem conhecer são definidos. A metafísica procura conhecer factos in ou mal definidos. Mas, antes de conhecidos, todos os factos são indefinidos; e toda a ciência, em relação a eles, está no estado da metafísica. Por isso chamarei à metafísica, não uma arte, mas uma ciência virtual, pois que tende para conhecer e ainda não conhece. Se ficará sempre virtual, se o não ficará; se há outro «plano» ou vida em que deixe de ser virtual — são coisas que nem eu nem Fernando Pessoa sabemos, porque verdadeiramente não sabemos nada.\\nRepare Fernando Pessoa que a sociologia é uma ciência tão virtual como a metafísica. A que conclusão, escassa que seja, se chegou já em sociologia? Positivamente, a nenhuma. Um congresso de sociologia, ocupando-se de ao menos definir essa ciência, não o conseguiu. A política moderna é tão complicadamente confusa porque o espírito moderno obriga-nos (talvez sem razão) a buscar uma ciência para tudo, e, como aqui não temos uma ciência mas só a preocupação de a ter, cada um toma por absoluta a sociologia relativa, isto é nula, que inventou ou que, mais ou menos estropiadamente, assimilou de outro que também no assunto não sabia nada. Compare Fernando Pessoa as discussões dos escolásticos com, sobretudo, as dos socialistas, comunistas e anarquistas modernos. É o mesmo especulativismo de manicómio, ressalvando que os escolásticos eram subtis, disciplinados no raciocínio e inofensivos, e os modernos «avançados» (como a si-próprios se chamam, como se houvesse «avanço» onde não há ciência) são estúpidos, confusos e, dada a pseudo-semicultura da época, incómodos. Discutir quantos anjos podem convenientemente fixar-se na ponta de uma agulha, pode ser improfícuo; mas não é menos improfícuo — e é com certeza mais engraçado — que discutir qual será ou deve ser o regime humanitário (e porque não anti-humanitário?) e equitativo (e porque não mais injunto e desigual do que o presente?) em que viverá a humanidade futura (e que sabemos nós, que ignoramos toda e qualquer lei sociológica, que desconhecemos portanto, mesmo sob a acção delas, quais são as forças naturais que actualmente nos regem e arrastam e para onde, o que será a humanidade futura, o que quererá — pois pode não querer para si o que qualquer de nós quer para ela — , ou mesmo se haverá humanidade futura, ou um cataclismo destruidor da terra, e da nossa sociologia ainda incompleta, e dos humanitarismos de bizantinos que não sabem ler?).\\nRepare ainda Fernando Pessoa no facto — que aliás cita em outra conexão — de que a ciência tende para ser matemática à medida que se aperfeiçoa, para reduzir tudo a fórmulas «abstractas», precisas, onde é máxima a libertação das «equações pessoais», isto é, dos erros de observação e coordenação produzidos pela falibilidade dos sentidos e do entendimento do observador ('). Ora «fórmulas abstractas» é justamente o que a metafísica procura. E a matemática, nos seus níveis «superiores», confina com a metafísica, ou, pelo menos, com ideias metafísicas. Tudo isto não quer dizer, é certo, que a metafísica venha a ser mais que uma ciência virtual, ou que não venha a ser mais. Quer dizer apenas que ela é efectivamente, não uma arte, mas uma ciência virtual.\\nPasmarão talvez destas considerações os que leram o meu Ultimatum, no «Portugal Futurista» (1917). Nesse Ultimatum lê-se sobre a filosofia uma opinião que parece, salvo que a precedeu, exactamente a mesma que a de Fernando Pessoa. Não é bem assim. A conclusão prática pode realmente ser idêntica, mas a conclusão teórica, que é a prática para uma teoria, é diferente.\\nA minha teoria, em resumo, era que: 1. ° — se deve substituir a filosofia por filosofias, isto é, mudar de metafísica como de camisa, substituindo à metafísica procura da verdade a metafísica procura da emoção e do interesse; e que 2. ° — se deve substituir a metafísica pela ciência.\\nE fácil de ver como esta teoria, tendo na prática quase os mesmos resultados que o pensamento de Fernando Pessoa, é diferente dele. Não rejeito a metafísica, rejeito as ciências virtuais todas, isto é, todas as ciências que não se aproximaram ainda do estado, vá, «matemático»; mas, para não desaproveitar essas ciências virtuais, que, porque existem, representam uma necessidade humana, faço artes delas, ou, antes proponho que se faça artes delas — da metafísica, metafísicas várias, buscando arranjar sistemas do universo coerentes e engraçados, mas sem lhes ligar intenção alguma de verdade, exactamente como em arte se descreve e expõe uma emoção interessante, sem se considerar se corresponde ou não a uma verdade objectiva de qualquer espécie.\\nE por esta mesma razão, por que substituo por partes as ciências virtuais no campo subjectivo, para não desamparar o desejo ou ambição humana que as faz existir, e exige, como todos os desejos, uma satisfação embora ilusória, que substituo as ciências virtuais pelas ciências reais no campo objectivo.\\nPonhamos ainda mais a claro a discordância entre mim e Fernando Pessoa. Para ele a metafísica é essencialmente arte, e a sociologia, de que não fala, é naturalmente, ciência. Para mim são, ambas e igualmente, essencialmente ciências, não o sendo porém ainda, nem talvez nunca, mas por uma razão extrínseca e não intrínseca. Proponho pois que se substituam por artes enquanto não são efectivamente ciências, o que pode ser que seja sempre, dando-se então na prática, entre a minha teoria e a de Fernando Pessoa, aquela coincidência de efeitos que não é rara entre teorias não só diversas, mas absolutamente opostas.\\nEsclareço ainda mais... A metafísica pode ser uma actividade científica, mas também pode ser uma actividade artística. Como actividade científica, virtual que seja, procura conhecer; como actividade artística, procura sentir. O campo da metafísica é o abstracto e o absoluto. Ora o abstracto e o absoluto podem ser sentidos, e não só pensados, pela simples razão de que tudo pode ser, e é, sentido. O abstracto pode ser considerado, ou sentido, como não-concreto, ou como directamente abstracto, isto é relativamente ou absolutamente. A emoção do abstracto como não concreto — isto é, indefinido — é a base, ou mesmo a essência, do sentimento religioso, incluindo neste sentimento tanto a religiosidade do Além, como a religiosidade laica de uma humanidade futura, porque, desde que se forme uma visão de uma humanidade definitiva, ou de um ideal político definitivo, isto é absoluto, sente-se não concretamente, porque se sente em relação à realidade concreta, mas em oposição ao «fluxo e refluxo eterno», que é a base dela. A emoção do abstracto como abstracto — isto é, definido — é a base ou mesmo a essência, do sentimento metafísico. O sentimento metafísico e o religioso são directamente opostos, o que se vê claramente na infecundidade metafísica (a falta de grandes originalidades metafísicas) em épocas como a nossa, em que a especulação social utópica é o fenómeno marcante, e não haveria metafísica alguma se não houvesse deficiência da outra parte do espírito religioso, e aquela liberdade de pensamento que estimula toda a espécie de especulação; ou como a Idade Média, perdida na adaptação teológica de metafísicas gregas, e em cuja noite caliginosa só de vez em quando brilha metafisicamente o astro breve de uma heresia.\\nO sentimento religioso é inteiramente irracionalizável, nem pode haver teologia, ou sociologia utópica, senão por engano ou doença. O sentimento metafísico é racionalizável, como todo o sentimento de uma coisa definida, que basta tornar-se inteiramente definida para se tornar matéria racional, ou científica. Proponho eu, simplesmente, que a matéria da metafísica, enquanto não está inteiramente definida, e portanto em estado de se pensar, e a metafísica se tornar ciência, seja ao menos sentida, e a metafísica seja arte; visto que tudo, bom ou mau, verdadeiro ou falso, tem afinal, porque existe, um direito vital a existir.\\nA minha teoria estética e social no Ultimatum resume-se nisto: na irracionalização das actividades que não são (pelo menos ainda) racionalizáveis. Como a metafísica é uma ciência virtual, e a sociologia é outra, proponho a irracionalização de ambas — isto é, a metafísica tornada arte, o que a irracionaliza porque lhe tira a sua finalidade própria; e a sociologia tornada só a política, o que a irracionaliza porque a torna prática quando ela é teórica. Não proponho a substituição da metafísica pela religião e da sociologia pelo utopismo social, porque isso seria, não irracionalizar, mas subracionalizar essas actividades, dando-lhes, não uma finalidade diversa, mas um grau inferior da sua própria finalidade.\\nÉ isto, em resumo, o que defendi no meu Ultimatum. E as teorias, política e estética, inteiramente originais e novas, que proponho nessa proclamação, são, por uma razão lógica, inteiramente irracionais, exactamente como a vida.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0ÁLVARO DE CAMPOS\\n\\n(l) Convém que, para prevenção dos leigos, se faça uma observação, embora digressiva, a este respeito. As ciências, ao aproximarem-se do estado matemático, tornam-se mais precisas: é porém duvidoso que, por isso, se tornem mais certas. Tanto os puros matemáticos como os leigos em matemática tendem a atribuir a essa ciência um carácter de «certeza» que não é necessariamente exacto. A matemática é uma linguagem perfeita, mais nada. Há a considerar a relatividade dos próprios princípios matemáticos — não a simples relatividade condicional, conhecida há muito de todos que sabem que para muita aplicação prática, isto é, verdadeiramente científica da matemática, é preciso introduzir coeficientes de correcção; mas uma relatividade mesmo incondicional, sobejamente demonstrada já, por exemplo e para a geometria, pela existência de geometrias não-euclidianas, tão «certas» na aplicação como a «clássica». Convém ainda avisar esses mesmos leigos que a expressão «relatividade» é aqui empregada no seu sentido tradicional e lógico, e não no sentido, aliás infeliz e absurdo, em que se chama «da relatividade» à teoria de Einstein, que é simplesmente uma teoria, primeiro restrita, depois generalizada, do movimento relativo.\\n\",\n",

Se não vinga, a que vem a ideia monárquica?

Between the love of children and the idea of colour there is a difference; but it is a difference much the same as that between colour and sound. In both cases there is a heterogeneity. The fact that colour and sound are given us by the senses is no argument. There must also be a sense for the perception of emotions — a certain tactus interior. (Or, perchance, fear, love are dependant on the sense of touch. But this is very doubtful.) — Thus we tremble when we feel fear. There is no fear without trembling.

Estas geometrias têm cada uma um desenvolvimento lógico: são sistemas interpretativos independentes, independentemente aplicáveis à realidade. Foi fecundo em matemática e além da matemática (Einstein bastante lhe deve) este processo de multiplicar as geometrias «verdadeiras», e fazer, por assim dizer, abstracções de vários tipos na mesma realidade objectiva.\\nOra, assim como se podem formar, se formaram, e foi útil que se formassem, geometrias não euclidianas, não sei que razão se poderá invocar para que não possam formar-se, não se formem, e não seja útil que se formem, estéticas não-aristotélicas .\\nHá muito tempo que, sem reparar que o fazia, formulei uma estética não aristotélica. Quero deixar escritos estes apontamentos para ela, em paralelo, não sei se modesto, com a tese de Riemann sobre a geometria clássica.\\nChamo estética aristotélica à que pretende que o fim da arte é a beleza, ou, dizendo melhor, a produção nos outros da mesma impressão que a que nasce da contemplação ou sensação das coisas belas. Para a arte clássica — e as suas derivadas, a romântica, a decadente, e outras assim — a beleza é o fim; divergem apenas os caminhos para esse fim, exactamente como em matemática se podem fazer diversas demonstrações do mesmo teorema. A arte clássica deu-nos obras grandes e sublimes, o que não quer dizer que a teoria da construção dessas obras seja certa, ou que seja a única teoria «certa». É frequente, aliás, e tanto na vida teórica como na prática, chegar-se a um resultado certo por processos incertos ou mesmo errados.\\nCreio poder formular uma estética baseada, não na ideia de beleza, mas na de força — tomando, é claro, a palavra força no seu sentido abstracto e científico; porque se fosse no vulgar, tratar-se-ia, de certa maneira, apenas de uma forma disfarçada de beleza. Esta nova estética, ao mesmo tempo que admite como boas grande número de obras clássicas — admitindo-as porém por uma razão diferente da dos aristotélicos, que foi naturalmente também a dos seus autores — estabelece uma possibilidade de construírem novas espécies de obras de arte que quem sustente a teoria aristotélica não poderia prever ou aceitar.\\nA arte, para mim, é, como toda a actividade, um indício de força, ou energia; mas, como a arte é produzida por entes vivos, sendo pois um produto da vida, as formas da força que se manifestam na arte são as formas da força que se manifestam na vida. Ora a força vital é dupla, de integração e de desintegração — anabolismo e catabolismo, como dizem os fisiologistas. Sem a coexistência e equilíbrio destas duas forças não há vida, pois a pura integração é a ausência da vida e a pura desintegração é a morte. Como estas forças essencialmente se opõem e se equilibram para haver, e enquanto há, vida, a vida é uma acção acompanhada automática e intrinsecamente da reacção correspondente. E é no automatismo da reacção que reside o fenómeno específico da vida.\\nO valor de uma vida, isto é, a vitalidade de um organismo, reside pois na intensidade da sua força de reacção. Como, porém, esta reacção é automática, e equilibra a acção que a provoca, igual, isto é, igualmente grande, tem que ser a força de acção, isto é, de desintegração. Para haver intensidade ou valor vital (no conceito de vida não pode caber outro conceito de valor que não o de intensidade, isto é, de grau de vida), ou vitalidade, é forçoso que essas duas forças sejam ambas intensas, mas iguais, pois, se o não forem, não só não há equilíbrio mas também uma das forças é pequena, pelo menos em relação à outra. Assim o equilíbrio vital é, não um facto directo — como querem para a arte (não esqueçamos o fim destes apontamentos) os aristotélicos — mas o resultado abstracto do encontro de dois factos.\\nOra a arte, como é feita por se sentir e para se sentir — sem o que seria ciência ou propaganda — baseia-se na sensibilidade. A sensibilidade é pois a vida da arte. Dentro da sensibilidade, portanto, é que tem que haver a acção e a reacção que fazem a arte viver, a desintegração e integração que, equilibrando-se lhe dão vida. Se a força de integração viesse, na arte, de fora da sensibilidade, viria de fora da vida; não se trataria de uma reacção automática ou natural, mas de uma reacção mecânica ou artificial.\\nComo aplicaremos à arte o princípio vital de integração e desintegração? O problema não oferece dificuldades; como a maioria dos problemas, basta, para o resolver, ver bem que problema ele é. Indo ao aspecto fundamental da integração e da desintegração, isto é, à sua manifestação no mundo chamado inorgânico, vemos a integração manifestar-se como coesão, a desintegração como ruptibilidade, isto é, tendência a, por causas (neste nível) quase todas macroscopicamente externas — aliás perpetuamente operantes, em grau menor ou maior — o corpo se cindir, se quebrar, deixar de ser o corpo que é. No mundo chamado orgânico mantêm-se, variando o nome porque a forma de manifestação, estas duas forças. Na sensibilidade o princípio de coesão vem do indivíduo, que essa sensibilidade caracteriza, ou, antes, essa forma de sensibilidade, pois é a forma-tomando este termo no sentido abstracto e completo-que define o composto individualizado. Na sensibilidade o princípio de ruptibilidade está em variadíssimas forças, na sua maioria externas, que, porém se reflectem no indivíduo físico através da não-sensibilidade, isto é, da inteligência e da vontade — a primeira tendendo a desintegrar a sensibilidade perturbando-a, inserindo nela elementos (ideias) gerais e assim contrários necessariamente aos individuais, a tornar a sensibilidade humana em vez de pessoal; a segunda tendendo a desintegrar a sensibilidade limitando-a, tirando-lhe todos aqueles elementos que não sirvam, ou, por excessivos, à acção em si, ou, por supérfluos, à acção rápida e perfeita, a tornar pois a sensibilidade centrífuga em vez de centrípeta.\\nContra estas tendências disruptivas a sensibilidade reage, para coerir, e como toda a vida, reage por uma forma especial de coesão, que é a assimilação, isto é, a conversão dos elementos das forças estranhas em elementos próprios, em substância sua.\\nAssim, ao contrário da estética aristotélica, que exige que o indivíduo generalize ou humanize a sua sensibilidade, necessariamente particular e pessoal, nesta teoria o percurso indicado é inverso: é o geral que deve ser particularizado, o humano que se deve pessoalizar, o «exterior» que se deve tornar «interior».\\nCreio esta teoria mais lógica — se é que há lógica — que a aristotélica; e creio-o pela simples razão de que, nela, a arte fica o contrário da ciência, o que na aristotélica não acontece. Na estética aristotélica, como na ciência, parte-se, em arte, do particular para o geral; nesta teoria parte-se, em arte, do geral para o particular, ao contrário de na ciência, em que, com efeito e sem dúvida, é do particular para o geral que se parte. E como ciência e arte são, como é intuitivo e axiomático, actividades opostas, opostos devem ser os seus modos de manifestação, e mais provavelmente certa a teoria que dê esses modos como realmente opostos que aquela que os dê como convergentes ou semelhantes.\\n\\nII\\n\\nAcima de tudo, a arte é um fenómeno social. Ora no homem há duas qualidades directamente sociais, isto é, dizendo directamente respeito à sua vida social: o espírito gregário, que o faz sentir-se igual aos outros homens ou parecido com eles, e portanto aproximar-se deles; e o espírito individual ou separativo, que o faz afastar-se deles, colocar-se em oposição a eles, ser seu concorrente, seu inimigo, ou seu meio inimigo. Qualquer indivíduo é ao mesmo tempo indivíduo e humano: difere de todos os outros e parece-se com todos os outros.\\nUma vida social sã no indivíduo resulta do equilíbrio destes dois sentimentos: uma fraternidade agressiva define o homem social e são. Ora se a arte é um fenómeno social, no ser social vai já o elemento gregário; resta saber onde está nela o elemento separativo. Não o podemos buscar fora da arte, porque então haveria na arte um elemento estranho a ela, e ela seria tanto menos arte; temos que o buscar dentro da arte — isto é, o elemento separativo tem que se manifestar na arte também, e como arte.\\nQuer isto dizer que, na arte, que é antes de tudo um fenómeno social, tanto o espírito gregário como o separativo têm que assumir a forma social.\\nOra o espírito separativo, antigregário, tem, é claro, duas formas: o afastamento dos outros, e a imposição do indivíduo aos outros, a sobreposição do indivíduo aos outros — o isolamento e o domínio. Destas duas formas a segunda é que é a forma social, pois isolar-se é deixar de ser social. A arte, portanto, é antes de tudo, um esforço para dominar os outros. Há, evidentemente, várias maneiras de dominar ou procurar dominar os outros; a arte é uma delas.\\nOra há dois processos de dominar ou vencer — captar e subjugar. Captar é o modo gregário de dominar ou vencer; subjugar é o modo antigregário de dominar ou vencer.\\nOra em todas as actividades sociais superiores há estes dois processos, porque fatalmente não pode haver outros; e se me refiro distintamente às actividades sociais superiores é que são estas, porque são superiores, as que envolvem a ideia de domínio. São três as actividades sociais superiores — a política, a religião e a arte. Em cada um destes ramos da actividade social superior há o processo de captação e o processo de subjugação.\\nNa política há a democracia, que é a política de captação, e a ditadura, que é a política de subjugação. É democrático todo o sistema que vive de agradar e de captar — seja a captação oligárquica ou plutocrática da democracia moderna, que, no fundo, não capta senão certas minorias, que incluem ou excluem a maioria autêntica; seja a captação mística e representativa da monarquia medieval, único sistema portanto verdadeiramente democrático, pois só a monarquia, pelo seu carácter essencialmente místico, pode captar as maiorias e os conjuntos, organicamente místicos na sua profunda vida mental. É ditatorial todo o sistema político que vive de subordinar e de subjugar — seja o despotismo artificial do tirano de força física, inorgânico e irrepresentativo, como nos impérios decadentes e nas ditaduras políticas; seja o despotismo natural do tirano de força mental, orgânico e representativo, enviado oculto, na ocasião da sua hora, dos destinos subconscientes de um povo.\\nNa religião há a metafísica, que é a religião de captação, porque tenta insinuar-se pelo raciocínio, e explicar ou provar é querer captar; e há a religião propriamente dita, que é o sistema de subjugação, porque subjuga pelo dogma improvado e pelo ritual inexplicável, agindo assim directa e superiormente sobre a confusão das almas.\\nAssim como na política e na religião, assim na arte. Há uma arte que domina captando, outra que domina subjugando. A primeira é a arte segundo Aristóteles, a segunda a arte como eu a entendo e defendo. A primeira baseia-se naturalmente na ideia de beleza, porque se baseia no que agrada; baseia-se na inteligência, porque se baseia no que, por ser geral, é compreensível e por isso agradável; baseia-se na unidade artificial, construída e inorgânica, e portanto visível, como a de uma máquina, e por isso apreciável e agradável. A segunda baseia-se naturalmente na ideia de força, porque se baseia no que subjuga; baseia-se na sensibilidade, porque é a sensibilidade que é particular e pessoal, e é com o que é particular e pessoal em nós que dominamos, porque, se não fosse assim, dominar seria perder a personalidade, ou, em outras palavras, ser dominado; e baseia-se na unidade espontânea e orgânica, natural, que pode ser sentida ou não sentida, mas que nunca pode ser vista ou visível, porque não está ali para se ver.\\nToda a arte parte da sensibilidade e nela realmente se baseia. Mas, ao passo que o artista aristotélico subordina a sua sensibilidade à sua inteligência, para poder tornar essa sensibilidade humana e universal, ou seja para a poder tornar acessível e agradável, e assim poder captar os outros, o artista não-aristotélico subordina tudo à sua sensibilidade, converte tudo em substância de sensibilidade, para assim, tornando a sua sensibilidade abstracta como a inteligência (sem deixar de ser sensibilidade), emissora como a vontade (sem que seja por isso vontade), se tornar um foco emissor abstracto sensível que force os outros, queiram eles ou não, a sentir o que ele sentiu, que os domine pela força inexplicável, como o atleta mais forte domina o mais fraco, como o ditador espontâneo subjuga o povo todo (porque é ele todo sintetizado e por isso mais forte que ele todo somado), como o fundador de religiões converte dogmática e absurdamente as almas alheias na substância de uma doutrina que, no fundo, não é senão ele próprio.\\nO artista verdadeiro é um foco dinamogéneo; o artista falso, ou aristotélico, é um mero aparelho transformador, destinado apenas a converter a corrente contínua da sua própria sensibilidade na corrente alterna da inteligência alheia.\\nOra entre os artistas «clássicos», isto é, aristotélicos, há verdadeiros e falsos artistas; e também nos não-aristotélicos há verdadeiros artistas e há simples simuladores — porque não é a teoria que faz o artista, mas o ter nascido artista. O que porém entendo e defendo é que todo o verdadeiro artista está dentro da minha teoria, julgue-se ele aristotélico ou não; e todo o falso artista está dentro da teoria aristotélica, mesmo que pretenda ser não-aristotélico. É o que falta explicar e demonstrar.\\nA minha teoria estética baseia-se — ao contrário da aristotélica, que assenta na ideia de beleza — na ideia de força. Ora a ideia de beleza pode ser uma força. Quando a «ideia» de beleza seja uma «ideia» da sensibilidade, uma emoção e não uma ideia, uma disposição sensível do temperamento, essa «ideia» de beleza é uma força. Só quando é uma simples ideia intelectual de beleza é que não é uma força.\\nAssim a arte dos gregos é grande mesmo no meu critério, e sobretudo o é no meu critério. A beleza, a harmonia, a proporção não eram para os gregos conceitos da sua inteligência, mas disposições íntimas da sua sensibilidade. É por isso que eles eram um povo de estetas, procurando, exigindo a beleza todos, em tudo, sempre. É por isso que com tal violência emitiram a sua sensibilidade sobre o mundo futuro que ainda vivemos súbditos da opressão dela. A nossa sensibilidade, porém, é já tão diferente — de trabalhada que tem sido por tantas e tão prolongadas forças sociais — que já não podemos receber essa emissão com a sensibilidade, mas apenas com a inteligência. Consumou este nosso desastre estético a circunstância de que recebemos em geral essa emissão da sensibilidade grega através dos romanos e dos franceses. Os primeiros, embora próximos dos gregos no tempo, eram, e foram sempre, a tal ponto incapazes de sentimento estético que tiveram que se valer da inteligência para receber a emissão da estética grega. Os segundos, estreitos de sensibilidade e pseudovivazes de inteligência, capazes portanto de «gosto» mas não de emoção estética, deformaram a já deformada romanização do helenismo, fotografaram elegantemente a pintura romana de uma estátua grega. Já é grande, para quem souber medi-la, a distância que vai da «Ilíada» à «Eneida» — tão grande que a não oculta mesmo uma tradução; a de um Píndaro a um Horácio parece infinita. Mas não é menor a que separa mesmo um Homero bidimensional como Vergílio, ou um Píndaro em projecção de mercator como Horácio, da chateza morta dum Boileau, dum Corneille, dum Racine, de todo o insuperável lixo estético do «classicismo» francês, esse «classicismo» cuja retórica póstuma ainda estrangula e desvirtua a admirável sensibilidade emissora de Vítor Hugo.\\nMas, assim como para os « clássicos», ou pseudoclássicos — os «aristotélicos» propriamente ditos — a beleza pode estar, não nas disposições da sua sensibilidade, mas só nas preocupações da sua razão, assim, para os não-aristotélicos postiços, pode a força ser uma ideia da inteligência e não uma disposição da sensibilidade. E assim como a simples ideia intelectual de beleza não habilita a criar beleza, porque só a sensibilidade verdadeiramente cria, porque verdadeiramente emite, assim também a simples ideia intelectual de força, ou de não-beleza, não habilita a criar, mais que a outra, a força ou a não-beleza que pretende criar. É por isso que há — e em que abundância os há! — simuladores da arte da força ou da não-beleza, que nem criam beleza nem não-beleza, porque positivamente não podem criar nada; que nem fazem arte aristotélica falsa, porque a não querem fazer, nem arte aristotélica falsa, porque não pode haver arte não-aristotélica falsa. Mas em tudo isto fazem sem querer, e ainda que mal, arte aristotélica, porque fazem arte com a inteligência, e não com a sensibilidade. A maioria, senão a totalidade, dos chamados realistas, naturalistas, simbolistas, futuristas, são simples simuladores, não direi sem talento, mas pelo menos, e só alguns, só com o talento da simulação. O que escrevem, pintam ou esculpem pode ter interesse, mas é o interesse dos acrósticos, dos desenhos de um só traço e de outras coisas assim. Logo que se lhe não chame «arte», está bem.\\nDe resto, até hoje, data em que aparece pela primeira vez uma autêntica doutrina não aristotélica da arte, só houve três verdadeiras manifestações de arte não-aristotélica. A primeira está nos assombrosos poemas de Walt Whitman; a segunda está nos poemas mais que assombrosos do meu mestre Caeiro; a terceira está nas duas odes — a Ode Triunfal e a Ode Marítima — que publiquei no «Orpheu». Não pergunto se isto é imodéstia. Afirrno que é verdade.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0ÁLVARO DE CAMPOS\\n',\n",

Isto, porém, é duvidoso.\\nA vida é essencialmente acção, e o que o horóscopo indica é a acção que há na vida do nativo. Três coisas não há que buscar no horóscopo: (1) as qualidades fundamentais do indivíduo, quanto ao seu grau íntimo; (2) o ponto de partida social da sua vida; (3) o que resulta dele, e da vida que teve, depois da morte. Tudo, menos isto, o horóscopo inclui e define.\\nNão pasmemos de que seja apagado e fruste o horóscopo de tal grande artista que foi célebre só depois de morto: o horóscopo indicará qualidades artísticas (em grau que não podemos medir) e indicará obscuridade. Tudo será indicado em abstracto; só uma vidência nossa o poderá concretizar. (Tal é o sentido do primeiro apótema de Ptolomeu.)\\nExemplificando melhor: um horóscopo de poeta dramático poderá ser determinado como tal poderá, adentro desse horóscopo, ser indicada uma certa fama e um certo proveito. À parte isso, o horóscopo pode ser o de Shakespeare ou o de um poeta dramático de inferior nota, que, na época em que viveu, tenha tido uma vida, quanto a fama e proveito, idêntica ou semelhante à de Shakespeare. O horóscopo revela, pouco mais ou menos, o que o mundo vê. Nunca devemos esquecer este pormenor importantíssimo. Sem ele nada faremos da astrologia.\\n',\n",

O mais exterior e nulo dos sistemas iniciáticos — como o é hoje a maçonaria — serve este fim, logo que tenha conservado os símbolos pelos quais em nós se infiltra o primeiro conhecimento do oculto. O único fim com que os Rosa-Cruz instituíram a maçonaria exotérica é o de pôr muita gente em contacto com, por assim dizer, o aspecto externo da verdade oculta, podendo assim aqueles, que se sintam aptos, ascender a ela lentamente.\\n\\nHá, depois, a iniciação esotérica. Difere da primeira em que tem que ser buscada pelo discípulo, e por ele desejada e preparada em si mesmo. «Quando o discípulo está pronto», diz o velho lema dos ocultistas, «o mestre está pronto também.»\\nHá, por fim, a iniciação divina. Esta, não a dão nem exotéricos ou esotéricos menores, como a exotérica, nem até Mestres ou Esotéricos Maiores, como a esotérica; vem directamente, e por cima destes todos, das mesmas mãos, do que chamamos Deus. O tipo supremo desta iniciação é o de Jesus, a quem Deus, de nascença, converteu em sua mesma Essência, tornando-o Cristo.\\nIniciado exotérico é, por exemplo, qualquer mação, ou qualquer discípulo menor de uma sociedade teosófica ou antroposófica. Iniciado esotérico é ,por exemplo, um Rosa-Cruz, um Francis Bacon, seja. Iniciado Divino é, por exemplo, um Shakespeare. A este tipo de iniciação vulgarmente se chama génio.\\nQuando Shakespeare disse, «uns nascem grandes, outros chegam à grandeza, a outros é a grandeza imposta» deu, talvez sem querer e julgando ser simplesmente irónico, a chave das três iniciações, na ordem descendente. Outro sentido não tem a mesma frase do Cristo que diz o mesmo pela «a uns fazem eunucos desde o ventre materno», em que, por uma expressão simbólica que a intuição facilmente compreende, se exprime pelo eunuquismo o afastamento dos outros que caracteriza a iniciação.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\nNOTAS PARA A RECORDAÇÃO DO MEU MESTRE CAEIRO (algumas delas)\\n\\nConheci o meu mestre Caeiro em circunstâncias excepcionais — como todas as circunstâncias da vida, e sobretudo as que, não sendo nada em si mesmas, hão-de vir a ser tudo nos resultados.\\nDeixei em quase três quartos o meu curso escocês de engenharia naval; parti numa viagem ao Oriente; no regresso, desembarcando em Marselha, e sentindo um grande tédio de seguir, vim por terra até Lisboa. Um primo meu levou-me um dia de passeio ao Ribatejo; conhecia um primo de Caeiro, e tinha com ele negócios; encontrei-me com o que havia de ser meu mestre em casa desse primo. Não há mais que contar, porque isto é pequeno, como toda a fecundação.\\nVejo ainda, com claridade da alma, que as lágrimas da lembrança não empanam, porque a visão não é externa... Vejo-o diante de mim, vê-lo-ei talvez eternamente como primeiro o vi. Primeiro, os olhos azuis de criança que não têm medo; depois, os malares já um pouco salientes, a cor um pouco pálida, e o estranho ar grego, que vinha de dentro e era uma calma, e não de fora, porque não era expressão nem feições. O cabelo, quase abundante, era louro, mas, se faltava luz, acastanhava-se. A estatura era média, tendendo para mais alta, mas curvada, sem ombros altos. O gesto era branco, o sorriso era como era, a voz era igual, lançada num tom de quem não procura senão dizer o que está dizendo-nem alta, nem baixa, clara, livre de intenções, de hesitações, de timidezas. O olhar azul não sabia deixar de fitar. Se a nossa observação estranhava qualquer coisa, encontrava-a: a testa, sem ser alta, era poderosamente branca. Repito: era pela sua brancura, que parecia maior que a da cara pálida, que tinha majestade. As mãos um pouco delgadas, mas não muito; a palma era larga. A expressão da boca, a última coisa em que se reparava — como se falar fosse, para este homem, menos que existir — era a de um sorriso como o que se atribui em verso às coisas inanimadas belas, só porque nos agradam — flores, campos largos, águas com sol — um sorriso de existir, e não de nos falar.\\nMeu mestre, meu mestre, perdido tão cedo! Revejo-o na sombra que sou em mim, na memória que conservo do que sou de morto...\\nFoi durante a nossa primeira conversa. Como foi não sei, e ele disse: «Está aqui um rapaz Ricardo Reis que há-de gostar de conhecer: ele é muito diferente de si». E depois acrescentou, «tudo é diferente de nós, e por isso é que tudo existe».\\nEsta frase, dita como se fosse um axioma da terra, seduziu-me com um abalo, como o de todas as primeiras posses, que me entrou nos alicerces da alma. Mas, ao contrário da sedução material, o efeito em mim foi de receber de repente, em todas as minhas sensações, uma virgindade que não tinha tido.\\n\\n*\\n\\nReferindo-me, uma vez, ao conceito directo das coisas, que caracteriza a sensibilidade de Caeiro, citei-lhe, com perversidade amiga, que Wordsworth designa um insensível pela expressão:\\n\\n A primrose by the river's brim  \\n\\nA yellow primrose was to him\\n\\n\\n\\xa0And it was nothing more.\\n\\n\\nE traduzi (omitindo a tradução exacta de «primrose», pois não sei nomes de flores nem de plantas): «Uma flor à margem do rio para ele era uma flor amarela, e não era mais nada».\\nO meu mestre Caeiro riu. «Esse simples via bem: uma flor amarela não é realmente senão uma flor amarela».\\nMas, de repente, pensou.\\n«Há uma diferença», acrescentou. «Depende se se considera a flor amarela como uma das várias flores amarelas, ou como aquela flor amarela só».\\nE depois disse:\\n«O que esse seu poeta inglês queria dizer é que para o tal homem essa flor amarela era uma experiência vulgar, ou coisa conhecida. Ora isso é que não está bem. Toda a coisa que vemos, devemos vê-la sempre pela primeira vez, porque realmente é a primeira vez que a vemos. E então cada flor amarela é uma nova flor amarela, ainda que seja o que se chama a mesma de ontem. A gente não é já o mesmo nem a flor a mesma. O próprio amarelo não pode ser já o mesmo. É pena a gente não ter exactamente os olhos para saber isso, porque então éramos todos felizes».\\n\\n*\\n\\nO meu mestre Caeiro não era um pagão: era o paganismo. O Ricardo Reis é um pagão, o António Mora é um pagão, eu sou um pagão; o próprio Fernando Pessoa seria um pagão, se não fosse um novelo embrulhado para o lado de dentro. Mas o Ricardo Reis é um pagão por carácter, o António Mora é um pagão por inteligência, eu sou um pagão por revolta, isto é, por temperamento. Em Caeiro não havia explicação para o paganismo; havia consubstanciação.\\nVou definir isto da maneira em que se definem as coisas indefiníveis — pela cobardia do exemplo. Uma das coisas que mais nitidamente nos sacodem na comparação de nós com os gregos é a ausência de conceito de infinito, a repugnância de infinito, entre os gregos. Ora o meu mestre Caeiro tinha lá mesmo esse mesmo conceito. Vou contar, creio que com grande exactidão, a conversa assombrosa em que mo revelou.\\nReferia-me ele, aliás desenvolvendo o que diz num dos poemas de «O Guardador de Rebanhos», que não sei quem lhe tinha chamado em tempos «poeta materialista». Sem achar a frase justa, porque o meu mestre Caeiro não é definível com qualquer frase justa, disse, contudo, que não era absurda de todo a atribuição. E expliquei-lhe, mais ou menos bem, o que é o materialismo clássico. Caeiro ouviu-me com uma atenção de cara dolorosa, e depois disse-me bruscamente:\\n«Mas isso o que é é muito estúpido. Isso é uma coisa de padres sem religião, e portanto sem desculpa nenhuma».\\nFiquei atónito, e apontei-lhe várias semelhanças entte o materialismo e a doutrina dele, salva a poesia desta última. Caeiro protestou.\\n«Mas isso a que V. chama poesia é que é tudo. Nem é poesia: é ver. Essa gente materialista é cega. V. diz que eles dizem que o espaço é infinito. Onde é que eles viram isso no espaço?»\\nE eu, desnorteado. «Mas V. não concebe o espaço como infinito? Você não pode conceber o espaço como infinito?»\\n«Não concebo nada como infinito. Como é que eu hei-de conceber qualquer coisa como infinito?»\\n«Homem», disse eu, «suponha um espaço. Para além desse espaço há mais espaço, para além desse mais, e depois mais, e mais, e mais... Não acaba...»\\n«Porquê?» disse o meu mestre Caeiro.\\nFiquei num terramoto mental. «Suponha que acaba», gritei. «O que há depois?»\\n«Se acaba, depois não há nada», respondeu.\\nEste género de argumentação, cumulativamente infantil e feminina, e portanto irresponsável, atou-me o cérebro durante uns momentos.\\n«Mas V. concebe isso?» deixei cair por fim.\\n«Se concebo o quê? Uma coisa ter limites? Pudera! O que não tem limites não existe. Existir é haver outra coisa qualquer e portanto cada coisa ser limitada. O que é que custa conceber que uma coisa é uma coisa, e não está sempre a ser uma outra coisa que está mais adiante?»\\nNessa altura senti carnalmente que estava discutindo, não com outro homem, mas com outro universo. Fiz uma última tentativa, um desvio que me obriguei a sentir legítimo.\\n«Olhe, Caeiro... Considere os números... Onde é que acabam os números? Tomemos qualquer número — 34, por exemplo. Para além dele temos 35, 36, 37, 38, e assim sem poder parar. Não há número grande que não haja um número maior. . .»\\n«Mas isso são só números», protestou o meu mestre Caeiro.\\nE depois acrescentou, olhando-me com uma formidável infância:\\n«O que é o 34 na realidade?»\\n\\n*\\n\\nHá frases repentinas, profundas porque vêm do profundo, que definem um homem, ou, antes, com que um homem se define, sem definição. Não me esquece aquela em que Ricardo Reis uma vez se me definiu. Falava-se de mentir, e ele disse: «Abomino a mentira, porque é uma inexactidão». Todo o Ricardo Reis — passado, presente e futuro — está nisto.\\nO meu mestre caeiro, como não dizia senão o que era, pode ser definido por qualquer frase sua, escrita ou falada, sobretudo depois do período que começa do meio em diante de «O Guardador de Rebanhos». Mas, entre tantas frases que escreveu e se imprimem, entre tantas que me disse o relato ou não relato, a que o contém com maior simplicidade é aquela que uma vez me disse em Lisboa. Falava-se de não sei quê que tinha que ver com as relações de cada qual consigo mesmo. E eu perguntei de repente ao meu mestre Caeiro, «está contente consigo?» E ele respondeu: «Não: estou contente». Era como a voz da Terra, que é tudo e ninguém.\\n\\n*\\n\\nNunca vi triste o meu mestre Caeiro. Não sei se estava triste quando morreu, ou nos dias antes. Seria possível sabê-lo, mas a verdade é que nunca ousei perguntar aos que assistiram à morte qualquer coisa da morte ou de como ele a teve.\\nEm todo o caso, foi uma das angústias da minha vida — das angústias reais em meio de tantas que têm sido fictícias —  que Caeiro morresse sem eu estar ao pé dele. Isto é estúpido mas humano, e é assim.\\nEu estava em Inglaterra. O próprio Ricardo Reis não estava em Lisboa; estava de volta no Brasil. Estava o Fernando Pessoa, mas é como se não estivesse. O Fernando Pessoa sente as coisas mas não se mexe, nem mesmo por dentro.\\nNada me consola de não ter estado em Lisboa nesse dia, a não ser aquela consolação que pensar no meu mestre Caeiro espontaneamente me dá. Ninguém é inconsolável ao pé da memória de Caeiro, ou dos seus versos; e a própria ideia do nada — a mais pavorosa de todas se se pensa com a sensibilidade — tem, na obra e na recordação do meu mestre querido, qualquer coisa de luminoso e de alto, como o sol sobre as neves dos píncaros inatingíveis.\\n\",\n",

E é-o porque nele se concentraram, e, de certo modo, revelaram o seu maquinismo interno, as várias forças, os vários (...) que entram em jogo na formação actual — herdada como mostrarei [?] — da pátria portuguesa. Na investigação a que vamos proceder não isolaremos, portanto, o sidonismo, senão para, analisando-o, analisar, nele, essas forças [...] todas.\\nÉ evidente que, para estudarmos bem este problema do sentido do sidonismo, teríamos, em boa razão científica, que começar por um estudo da condição da sociedade (política) portuguesa aquando do advento de Sidónio; para isso teríamos que escrever, em prefácio, uma história de Portugal, sociologicamente feita; e, para que a fizéssemos sociologicamente, que pôr a esse prefácio, como introdução, um tratado inteiro de sociologia. O escrever de um tratado de sociologia incluiria, já, o estudo liminar dos fundamentos de tal ciência ou proto ciência; o que quer dizer que para estudar o \"sentido do sidonismo\" teríamos, em boa razão científica, que começar por estudar os sistemas modernos. Assim são todos os problemas, ainda que não [...]\\nA estes extremos, absurdos tanto pela impossibilidade como pela desproporção entre a cultura do teórico e o abrangimento dos seus [...] Não é mister, porém, que um tão doentio escrúpulo de certeza possível haja de ser cumprido; mas que a uma metodologia tão complexa haja de ser submetido o problema.\\nComo o Sidonismo é um fenómeno, [...], da vida da nossa República, começaremos por uma análise sumária das causas políticas dessa República. Políticas, dizíamos nós; e não nos é muito próprio de algum modo ter que limitar a tese. Assim, as causas da vida republicana serão o [...]: e essas serão as causas das quais se [...]\\nDepois, o Sidonismo apareceu a certa altura da vida da República, e o movimento de 8 de Dezembro foi uma contra-revolução republicana.

       "  'text': '\\nNOTA AO ACASO\\n\\nO poeta superior diz o que efectivamente sente. O poeta médio diz o que decide sentir. O poeta inferior diz o que julga que deve sentir.\\nNada disto tem que ver com a sinceridade. Em primeiro lugar, ninguém sabe o que verdadeiramente sente: é possível sentirmos alívio com a morte de alguém querido, e julgar que estamos sentindo pena, porque é isso que se deve sentir nessas ocasiões. A maioria da gente sente convencionalmente, embora com a maior sinceridade humana; o que não sente é com qualquer espécie ou grau de sinceridade intelectual, e essa é que importa no poeta. Tanto assim é que não creio que haja, em toda a já longa história da Poesia, mais que uns quatro ou cinco poetas, que disessem o que verdadeiramente, e não só efectivamente, sentiam. Há alguns, muito grandes, que nunca o disseram, que foram sempre incapazes de o dizer. Quando muito há, em certos poetas, momentos em que dizem o que sentem. Aqui e ali o disse Wordsworth. Uma ou duas vezes o disse Coleridge: pois a Rima do Velho Nauta e Kubla Khan são mais sinceros que todo o Milton, direi mesmo que todo o Shakespeare. Há apenas uma reserva com respeito a Shakespeare: é que Shakespeare era essencial e estruturalmente factício; e por isso a sua constante insinceridade chega a ser uma constante sinceridade, de onde a sua grandeza.\\nQuando um poeta inferior sente, sente sempre por caderno de encargos. Pode ser sincero na emoção: que importa, se o não é na poesia? Há poetas que atiram com o que sentem para o verso; nunca verificaram que o não sentiram. Chora Camões a perda da alma sua gentil; e afinal quem chora é Petrarca. Se Camões tivesse tido a emoção sinceramente sua, teria encontrado uma forma nova, palavras novas — tudo menos o soneto e o verso de dez sílabas. Mas não: usou o soneto em decassílabos como usaria luto na vida.\\nO meu mestre Caeiro foi o único poeta inteiramente sincero do mundo.\\n',\n",

Se não oferece estabilidade, resulta anárquica, e impossível o progresso; se não progride, não pode dizer-se uma sociedade civilizada.\\nA estabilidade social envolve que não exista um estado de tirania completa (...).\\nO estado social que torna possível o progresso é o equilíbrio de tiranias. Quanto mais intensa é a tendência para a tirania de cada parte, mais fecundo é o estado de progresso.\\nA. — Mas isso quereria dizer que a tirania é que causa o progresso, ou, pelo menos, que é a condição dele.\\nF. — Não. Eu não disse a tirania, mas o conflito e equilíbrio de duas tiranias. O progresso nasce da neutralização mútua das duas, não da acção de cada uma de per si, ou das duas conjuntamente como tiranias.\\nF. — Se reparares, verificarás que as obras mais permanentes do espírito humano datam das épocas em que se travava uma guerra civil patente ou iminente no país onde foram produzidas. Isto não quer dizer que um estado de revolução seja a essência causal da obra permanente. Mas quer dizer que um estado de revolução é (...)\\nF. — O progresso é uma revolta contra a espécie. Não é por um absurdo qualquer que se diz que os homens de génio são doentes ou loucos. O génio é inadaptação, isto é, doença, porque o génio é criação. Criar é não estar satisfeito. (António.)\\nAnt.º — Criar é não estar satisfeito. Toda a criação envolve uma rejeição do que não precisa ser criado. Todo o gesto feito hoje é uma revolta contra o gesto feito ontem. Criar é abster-se. Criar é dispensar-se de coexistir.

A Inquisição, que queimava os infiéis e os suspeitos; as perseguições religiosas, que exterminavam os contrários — nada disso é tirania religiosa: tudo isso é tirania política. A tirania religiosa é outra, de mais subtil e depravada espécie. A tirania religiosa é de índole hereditária e pedagógica. Cada vez que, opresso pela vida e posto à prova pela amargura, me lembro, no auge da minha angústia, de rezar, de recorrer à ideia de Cristo — então sou servo da verdadeira tirania religiosa. Cada vez que, perante os pobres (...) me enterneço e me comovo, e choro a sorte do mundo, sou servo da tirania religiosa. A tirania religiosa é esta, é isto. A outra, que queima infiéis e escorraça pagãos, essa, corno te disse, é tirania política exercida em nome da religião.

       "  'title': 'Nestes poemas aparentemente tão símplices, o crítico, se se dispõe...\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nNestes poemas aparentemente tão símplices, o crítico, se se dispõe a uma análise cuidada, hora a hora se encontra defronte de elementos cada vez mais inesperados, cada vez mais complexos. Tomando por axiomático aquilo que, desde logo, o impressiona, a naturalidade e espontaneidade dos poemas de Caeiro, pasma de verificar que eles são, ao mesmo tempo, rigorosamente unificados por um pensamento filosófico que não só os coordena e concatena, mas que, ainda mais, prevê objecções, antevê críticas, explica defeitos por uma integração deles na substância espiritual da obra. Assim, dando-se Caeiro por um poeta objectivo, como é, nós encontramo-lo, em quatro das suas canções, exprimindo impressões inteiramente subjectivas. Mas não temos a satisfação cruel de poder supor-nos a indicar-lhe que errou. No poema que imediatamente precede essas canções, ele explica que elas foram escritas durante uma doença, e que, portanto, têm por força que ser diferentes dos seus poemas normais, por isso que a doença não é a saúde. E assim o crítico não chegue a conduzir aos lábios a taça da sua satisfação cruel. Se quiser ter a alegria, um pouco menos concreta, de apontar outros pecados contra a teoria íntima da obra toda, vê-se confrontado por poemas como o ...º e o ...º, onde a sua objecção já está feita, e a sua questão respondida.\\nSó quem pacientemente, e com o espírito pronto, ler esta obra pode avaliar o que esta previsão, esta coerência intelectual (mais ainda do que sentimental, ou emotiva) tem de desconcertante.\\nTudo isto, porém, é verdadeiramente o espírito pagão. Aquela ordem e disciplina que o paganismo tinha, e o cristismo nos fez perder, aquela inteligência raciocinada das coisas, que era seu apanágio e não é nosso, está ali. Porque, se falta na forma, aqui está na essência. E não é [a] forma exterior do paganismo — repito — que Caeiro veio reconstruir; é a essência que chamou do Averno, como Orfeu a Eurídice, pela magia harmónica (melódica) da sua emoção.\\nQuais são, para meu critério, os defeitos desta obra? Dois só, e eles pouco empanam o seu fulgor irmão dos deuses.\\nFalta, nos poemas de Caeiro, aquilo que devia completá-los: a disciplina exterior, pela qual a força tomasse a coerência e a ordem que reina no íntimo da Obra. Ele escolheu, como se vê, um verso que embora fortemente pessoal — como não podia deixar de ser — é ainda o verso livre dos modernos. Não subordinou a expressão a uma disciplina comparável aquela a que subordinou quase sempre a emoção e sempre a ideia. Perdoa-se-lhe a falta, porque aos inovadores muito se perdoa; mas não se pode omitir que seja uma falta, e não uma distinção.\\n\\nSemelhantemente, a emoção enferma ainda um pouco do\\n\\n \\n\\nmeio cristão em que surgiu para este mundo a alma do poeta. A ideia, sempre essencialmente pagã, usa por vezes um traje emotivo que não lhe é adequado. Em \\n\\nO Guardador de Rebanhos \\n\\nhá um aperfeiçoamento gradual neste sentido: os poemas finais — e sobretudo os quatro ou cinco que precedem os dois últimos — são de uma perfeita unidade ideia-emotiva. Eu perdoaria ao poeta que ele houvesse assim permanecido ainda escravo de certos apetrechos sentimentais da mentalidade cristista, se ele nunca, até ao fim da obra, se conseguisse libertar deles. Mas se, a dada altura da sua evolução poética, ele o fez, culpo-o, e severamente o culpo (como severamente, em pessoa, o culpei) de não voltar aos seus poemas anteriores, ajustando-os à sua disciplina adquirida, e, se alguns a essa disciplina se não sujeitassem, riscando-os inteiramente. Mas a coragem de sacrificar o que se fez é a que mais escasseia ao poeta. Tão mais difícil é refazer que fazer a primeira vez. Verdadeiramente, ao invés do que diz o prolóquio gálico, é o último passo o que mais custa.\\n\\nAssim eu acho o ...º poema, tão irritantemente enternecedor para um cristão, absolutamente deplorável para um poeta objectivo, para um reconstrutor da essência do paganismo. Nesse poema desce-se às últimas baixezas do subjectivismo cristista, indo até àquela mistura do objectivo com o subjectivo que é o distintivo doentio dos mais doentios dos modernos (desde certos pontos da obra intolerável do infeliz chamado Victor Hugo até à quase totalidade da magma amorfa que faz as vezes de poesia entre os nossos contemporâneos místicos).\\n\\nExagero, porventura, e abuso. Tendo aproveitado a ressurreição do paganismo que Caeiro conseguiu, e tendo, como todos os aproveitadores, conseguido a fácil arte secundária de aperfeiçoar, é talvez ingrato que me revolte contra os defeitos inerentes à inovação com que aproveitei. Mas, se os acho defeitos, tenho, embora os desculpe, que os apelidar de tais. \\n\\nMagis amica veritas.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nPor certo que a obra tem defeitos, e defeitos que, sendo para mim bem patentes, não empanam, salvo no pouco em que a empanam, a cintilação da obra.\\nRasgou Caeiro a névoa cristã, que encobre a natureza e as emoções que nascem dela. Mas nem rasgou inteiramente essa névoa, nem de todo a conseguiu erguer de diante dos seus próprios olhos. Ambas as incompletidões eram de esperar. Que não rasgasse de todo essa névoa, era certo de antemão, pois isso não podia ser obra de um homem, senão de gerações de homens, que nem só uma bastaria. Que a não afastasse de todo de diante dos seus próprios olhos, também era de esperar; pois na alma dele, como na de todos nós, jazia, mau grado a aspiração para o objectivismo, o fermento subjectivista cristão, que, sem que por tal demos, forma parte consubstanciada da essência do nosso ser espiritual. O mais pagão de nós tem que exprimir-se em uma linguagem cristã, porque as palavras nas suas relações entre si e o sentido de cada uma isoladamente (de per si) estão cristianizados. Como não falamos já grego, também não pensamos grego. Por isso na obra de Caeiro aparecem alguns elementos que, embora não escondam a sua essência, todavia a contradizem. Enumerarei esses elementos.\\n\\nPara primeiro o enumerar, escolherei aquele que é o mais evidente de todos — a forma poética adoptada, que é, para mim, inadmissível. Sei bem que essa forma tem um ritmo próprio, que nem se confunde com o ritmo dos versos livres de Whitman, nem com o dos versos livres dos franceses modernos. Esse ritmo, porém, nasce, na verdade, de uma incompetência de colocar o pensamento dentro de moldes estáveis; facilita demasiado, para que o possamos contar como valor. O objectivista deve, acima de tudo, tornar os seus poemas \\n\\nobjectos, \\n\\ncom contornos definidos, olhando a que obedeçam a leis exteriores a si próprios, como a pedra, quando cai, obedece à gravidade, que, sendo parte da «lógica» do seu movimento, não é parte da sua personalidade material, como tal exclusivamente considerada.\\n\\nApontarei, em seguida, como defeito — mais grave para mim, se bem que, bem o sei, muito menos grave para os outros — o banho morno de emotividade cristã em que alguns dos poemas são envolvidos, a simbologia cristista de que alguns deles, mesmo, se servem. Paira por parte do livro um romantismo naturalista qual .o que ensinaram à Europa os dulçorosos cânticos do abominável fundador da ordem franciscana. Por outros passa, como matéria estética, dispensável todavia, um sopro de mitologia cristã, que destoa da índole da obra. \\nSe a obra fosse, ou de um cristão, ou de um mero emotivo sem uma filosofia a soclear a sua arte, passasse esse defeito, que, aliás, mais não seria que um pecado a mais contra a natureza. Mas na obra do mais pagão, substancialmente, de todos os autores de todos os tempos, tal elemento desconsola e desconcerta, punge e desola.\\n\\nApontarei o terceiro, que é o último, defeito. Não é esse, já, da obra no seu conjunto, porém da trajectória por ela seguida. Desculpo-o, porque a doença, e, antes dela, uma daquelas perturbações emotivas que o homem forte — e tal deve o pagão ser — mesmo na juventude não deve sentir, a provocaram. Refiro-me ao caminho seguido pela inspiração de Caeiro, a partir do fim de \\n\\nO Guardador de Rebanhos — \\n\\nisto é, a contar dos dois pequenos poemas \\n\\nO Pastor Amoroso \\n\\naté ao fim. O cérebro do poeta torna-se confuso, a sua filosofia se entaramela, os seus princípios sofrem a derrota que, na indisciplina da alma, representa em espírito o que seja a vitória ignóbil de uma revolução de escravos. O leitor que tenha seguido a curva ascensional de \\n\\nO\\n\\n \\n\\nGuardador de Rebanhos \\n\\nverá, passado esse conjunto de poemas, como a inspiração se deteriora e se confunde. Não se desvia, propriamente: senão que sofre a intrusão de elementos estranhos a ela. Que o amigo desculpe o crítico, quando ele se vê forçado a afirmar que o poeta morreu a tempo. É possível que mudasse para o a que chegara. Não sei. Toda a hipótese deste género é absurda, porque o que foi era o que tinha de ser, que assim o quiseram, sob a mão invisível do \\n\\nFado,\\n\\n os\\n\\n \\n\\ndeuses senhores da matéria do nosso mundo.\\n\\nSão estes três defeitos que, a meu ver, empanam esta obra. São inevitáveis — um por o meio intelectual moderno, em que o autor vivia; outro pela própria espontaneidade e simpleza da obra, que buscava exprimir-se sem curar da forma, escrúpulo que ao discípulo, mais que ao mestre, compete; outra pela doença e pela perturbação do espírito. São defeitos inevitáveis, digo; não deixam por tal de ser defeitos, mas os defeitos inevitáveis são, em toda a obra, os menores. Assim esta obra, que se ergue sobranceira acima da nossa civilização abjecta, não tem senão os defeitos que lhe vêm de respirar aquele ar, acima do qual vai subindo. A outros, discípulos, compete expurgar as consequências dos defeitos que ainda empanam a causa. Mas o Mestre, que primeiro, em vinte séculos de névoa, deixou ver os contornos dos montes, e a realidade directa das pedras e das flores, não poderá ser esquecido enquanto os homens não se afastarem por completo dos caminhos do mundo e da matéria humana de que foram feitos.\\n',\n",

Caeiro podia ser infiel aos seus princípios; nunca podia ser inoriginal. Assim esses poemas de amor são únicos na poesia amorosa. Reparo que são assim sem por isso os admirar. Ponho mais alto, e a maior preço, a minha admiração. O próprio estado amoroso, embora natural, não é o estado próprio para a fixação de impressões que a arte é, salvo no caso dos raros artistas que conseguem ter constantemente mão em si, e a quem a inteligência tem sempre rédea na emoção. Mas esses mesmos, por certo, não ordenam como colunas de algarismos as suas emoções sexuais.\\n\\nO temperamento metafísico de Caeiro menos apto estava a receber as emoções amorosas, que, sobre serem já de si perturbadoras, mais o eram para um temperamento em que eram estranhas.

Ficou o rasto viciado. Nunca mais, salvo em evanescentes episódios poéticos, voltou aquela serenidade suprema, aquela visão de deus, a que, libertando-se pouco a pouco das acreções espirituais crististas, o poeta se havia librado no decurso do caminho a que chamou \\n\\nO Guardador de Rebanhos.\\n\\n\\nEscuso de insistir, porque, tendo sobradamente explicado em que consiste a obra de Caeiro, implicitamente expliquei em que degenerou, quando degenerou.

O voto social indica num partido político a confiança que resolve problemas relativos ao próprio votante, à classe do próprio votante. A diferença é capital. Porque mesmo que se queira retorquir que o motivo de delegação é o mesmo — isto é, o reconhecer o povo a sua incapacidade para raciocinadamente resolver os problemas —, com facilidade se responde que é natural que uma classe ou grupo delegue num partido da sua confiança (que pelo voto lhe indica) o tratar de questões gerais políticas, em que essa classe não entra como classe, nem lucra senão no que lhe caiba compartilhar do lucro geral do país. E isto porque necessariamente não é qualquer indivíduo mas apenas aqueles cuja nativa inteligência os [...] para isso, que pode tomar conta activa nos destinos de uma nação, e ter o poder intelectual necessário para abranger a sociedade como todo [...] e (...) para quem se legisla.

       "  'text': '\\n\\nTão pouco se assemelha ao politeísmo da Índia, e a diferença foi apontada, com uma distinção subtilíssima e justa, em uma frase de Heródoto, onde se diz que os deuses da Índia eram (são) de forma humana, mas os da Grécia de natureza humana. \\n\\n(intercalar os termos gregos) .\\n\\n\\n\\nCaeiro, no seu objectivismo total, ou, antes, na sua tendência constante para um objectivismo total, é frequentemente mais grego que os próprios gregos. Duvido que grego algum escrevesse aquela frase culminante de \\n\\nO Guardador de Rebanhos:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Natureza é partes sem um todo,\\n\\n\\nonde o objectivismo vai até à sua conclusão fatal e última, a negação de um Todo, que a experiência dos sentidos não autoriza sem a intromissão, para o caso externa, do pensamento. Aqui, como em outros pontos, é Caeiro, como digo, mais grego que os gregos.\\n\\nFalo de mim, porque, afinal, de ninguém melhor poderia falar. Também me entrego, conforme posso e a índole me indica, ao mesmo exercício literário que Caeiro. E nas composições com que os deuses me concedem que eu entretenha os meus ócios, eu sou, discipularmente, do mesmo paganismo que Caeiro, acrescentando-lhe porém a forma mais precisa que a essência me parece necessitar, e a crença na realidade exterior e absoluta dos Deuses antigos, que a minha índole religiosa me pede sem que eu pretenda furtar-me a essa solicitação. Mas sem Caeiro tudo isto me seria impossível. Eu sou, é certo, um pagão nado. Por um \\n\\nlusus naturae, \\n\\ncuja razão não sei, mas que é curioso que acontecesse a pouca distância no tempo daquele que Caeiro representa, nasci com um temperamento tal, que o objectivismo me é natural e próprio. Mas, repito, eu ficaria, quando muito, presa de um mal-estar instintivo e inexplicável, descrente no cristismo e sem crença possível, se não me tivesse vindo a revelação da obra de Caeiro. Eu era como o cego de nascença, em quem há porém a possibilidade de ver; e o meu conhecimento com \\n\\nO\\n\\n \\n\\nGuardador de Rebanhos \\n\\nfoi a mão do cirurgião que me abriu, com os olhos, a vista. Em um momento transformou-se-me a Terra, e todo o mundo adquiriu o sentido que eu tivera instintivo em mim. Exponho estes factos, não só para mostrar o que é, num terreno apropriado, a influência da obra de Caeiro, como para que o leitor, sabendo-me assim grato, e por quanto sou grato, possa dar nas minhas palavras o desconto que julgue dever-se ao que nelas, de excessivo ou de deformador, haja posto a minha grata admiração Posto o que, passo de mim, e vou ao caso geral do que esta obra ingente representa.\\n\\nEm algumas das considerações, que aqui foram feitas, colheu já o leitor atilado, que já o tenha sido da obra, alguns elementos para compreender a que me refiro.\\n\\nQue a obra de Caeiro representa uma tendência crescente (adentro de \\n\\nO\\n\\n \\n\\nG[uardador] de R[ebanhos]) \\n\\npara o objectivismo absoluto não há que duvidar, pois que para não duvidar basta ler. Repare-se que esse objectivismo absoluto está ao mesmo tempo no instintivo primário das emoções e dos sentidos, e no instintivo derivado das ideias, porque esta obra é, como todas as grandes obras de todos os tempos, um composto homogéneo onde, a par da profunda originalidade do género de emoções, há a profunda originalidade das ideias, suas pares, que as acompanham, e onde, a par da profundeza que comportam essas ideias e essas emoções, há a grande simplicidade da forma e da expressão ideativa.\\n\\n\\nTenho por seguro que muitos que lerem esta obra, dirão, chegados ao fim dela, que é excessivamente simples e fácil de fazer. Teremos, ainda outra vez, o velho caso, já secularmente proverbial, do ovo de Cristóbal Colón (Cristóvão Colombo). Nada há mais fácil que fazer coisas \\n\\nanálogas, \\n\\numa vez esta vista; por certo que nada há mais fácil. O segundo passo é proverbial que não custa, e menos custa quando o primeiro passo é dado pelos outros. Não julgue, porém, um poetastro qualquer dentre os leitores que, a não ser o plágio vulgar, ou o decalque directo de Caeiro, é fácil escrever neste género coisas que sejam sentidas e fortes. Nem julgue — muito menos o julgue — que é fácil, o que é possível, fazê-las originais dentro da mesma orientação. Mesmo, porém, que nada em tudo isto fosse verdade, e que esta obra nada tivesse de original, de profundamente novo, restaria por certo, e isso é inegável, no meio das obras poéticas da nossa época, que ou a introspecção excessiva torna estéreis, ou a preocupação da violência torna absurdas, ou o prejuízo social põe longe da arte, um manancial de pureza e de frescor. Quando mais não pudéssemos ir buscar à obra de Caeiro, poderíamos sempre ir lá buscar a Natureza. Cheia de pensamento, ela livra-nos de toda a dor de pensar. Cheia de emoção ela liberta-nos do peso inútil de sentir. Cheia de vida, ela põe-nos à parte do peso irremediável da vida que é forçoso que vivamos.\\n\\nE assim, mesmo que não fosse da grandeza que eu creio que ela é, era, ainda, grande e rica. Há horas em que eu creio, afinal, que a verdade completa estará na união destas duas opiniões, e que a obra de Caeiro é maior ainda, porque, a par da sua originalidade profunda e reveladora, ela é uma coisa natural que encanta e livra. São as horas em que, sem que eu esqueça o que ela é de renascença pagã, busco apenas nela consolar-me das malícias e das injustiças da vida. Vou então haurir nestes versos imortais a tranquilidade e o repouso. Porque esta obra, fora de ser o que é de inovador, é um repouso e um livramento, um refúgio e uma libertação.\\n[Var.:] Vou então haurir nesses versos imortais a tranquilidade e o sossego. Porque esta obra que, salvo pela forma, é completa, é um refúgio, além de ser um livramento; e é um repouso, sobre ser uma libertação.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nEntre as várias superstições verbais, de que se compõe a pseudo-inteligência da nossa época, a mais vulgarmente citada é a da opinião pública. E, como acontece com todas as superstições, que conseguem deveras enraizar-se, mas que não conseguem nunca tornar-se lúcidas, este critério instintivo respeitador da opinião pública em palavras, porque sente que há por detrás da frase uma realidade, mas pouco respeitador dela em actos, porque não sente definidamente que realidade é essa, é ao mesmo tempo o esteio e o vício das sociedades modernas.\\nTodos nós sentimos, qualquer que seja a nossa política, que, em última análise, toda a política tem que se conformar com a opinião pública, com a corrente predominante de opinião (corrente insistente de opinião). Quando, porém, se trata de definir o que seja uma corrente dessas, de que modo se manifesta, como se há-de distinguir a opinião pública de uma opinião parcial violenta ou intensa, o cérebro moderno, radicalmente indisciplinado, perde contacto com o problema e embrulha-se em palavras para não sentir o frio dos factos.\\nO problema, porém, embora complexo, não é de uma dificuldade tal que um cérebro decentemente lúcido haja de recuar ante analisá-lo. E, como, de todos os problemas modernos, é talvez o mais urgente em que se defina, porque é o que é substancial, não será porventura tempo perdido aquele se entregue à consideração dos elementos verdadeiramente constitutivos da opinião pública, e dos erros que, em torno a esse problema, se têm amontoado.\\nUrge, em primeiro lugar, e como é conveniente em problemas destes, reparar cuidadosamente em o que é que a frase, o termo, não significa. Comecemos por definir bem o que é que a opinião pública não é. Isso nos facilitará a investigação do que ela, efectivamente, seja.\\nAfastemos imediatamente os dois erros palmares, que se dão em relação a este problema. A opinião pública não significa a opinião da maioria. A opinião pública não significa uma opinião política, mesmo que se trate de uma opinião pública em matéria política. Livres destes dois erros, poderemos atirar pela borda fora os dois erros palmares da pseudo-sociologia da época — o erro democrático, e o erro de supor que a opinião pública vale pelo que se manifesta.\\nTratemos, primeiro, do erro democrático.\\nAntes de ser inteligência, o homem é instinto; e, ao passo que intelectualmente os homens diferem muito, tanto em quantum intelectual como em conteúdo intelectual, nos instintos diferem pouco. Temos, pois, que são os instintos que unem os homens e a inteligência que os separa. Uma sociedade é uma reunião de instintos, não é um concurso de inteligências. Não são as ideias que regem as sociedades, mas sim a ausência de ideias. Um povo vale pelo que não sabe que vale.\\nA psicologia moderna, embora ainda por constituir como ciência completa, ou, pelo menos, organizada, chegou, porém, a uma conclusão, diametralmente oposta àquela em que apoiava o século dezoito as suas filosofias. A ciência psicológica sabe que, no\\nhomem como nos animais, o inconsciente, ou subconsciente, predomina sobre o consciente; que o homem é primariamente um animal irracional, e apenas episodicamente racional; que o homem é, na sua essência, uma criatura de instintos, como todos os animais, e apenas por acréscimo e individualidade, um ente intelectual.\\nOra uma reunião de homens, se é mais que um grupo casual em uma rua, e é esse o caso de uma sociedade, une-se por aquilo que lhes é comum, e não por aquilo que é diferente em cada um dos outros. A base da vida social é portanto o instinto, que é fundamental nos homens como nos animais (que também são gregários) e não a inteligência. O homem só é inteligente quando separado dos outros homens; junto com eles é apenas instintivo e a sua inteligência não serve, dado o caso normal, senão para esclarecer o instinto.\\nSe a sociedade é uma aliança de instintos, um contrato social eternamente anterior aos que nele participam, segue que os fenómenos de psiquismo de conjunto, que se dêem em uma sociedade, são fenómenos do instinto, e não da inteligência.\\nO primeiro corolário desta conclusão é que o sistema democrático é profundamente anticientífico, que o princípio do sufrágio, como expressão da opinião, é um erro crasso. O instinto não se exprime, o instinto não se define.\\nQuando o instinto procura interpretar-se, erra; por isso os partidos políticos se apoiam nos erros que a inteligência faz ao interpretar o instinto. Uma vitória eleitoral é sempre a expressão da vitória da mais plausível das interpretações falsas da opinião pública.\\nVotar é errar. O voto é individual, e a essência da opinião é não ser susceptível de fraccionamento em indivíduos. A opinião pública é um ente, de que os indivíduos que, sem querer, a compõem são células; a opinião pública não é uma soma, nem mesmo uma síntese, é um facto pré-intelectual.\\nConcluir-se-á imediatamente: Se a opinião pública é só uma atmosfera e não uma corrente, se é um estado de alma colectiva e não uma tendência para a acção, como hão-de os homens públicos governar com a opinião pública? Como hão-de saber o que ela é, se a essência dela própria é não saber bem o que é?\\nO erro em uma objecção destas está no conceito democrático de governo. Se se julga que governar é seguir a opinião pública, não há resposta. Mas governar com a opinião pública não é segui-la; governar com a opinião pública é interpretá-la. A sociedade tem o seu esteio no instinto; o governo é um fenómeno intelectual. Ora a relação entre a inteligência e o instinto é interpretativa.\\nO estado de uma sociedade não depende das suas instituições políticas, mas da coesão entre os governantes e os governados. Quando essa coesão existe, isto é, quando a opinião pública, a opinião instintiva da nação e geral, individida, os próprios governantes partilham dela, dela participam. Basta-lhe, portanto, para governar, interpretarem o que está dentro de si próprios.\\nNas sociedades desnacionalizadas, nas sociedades estragadas pelas ideias estéreis do humanitarismo, do pacifismo e da fraternidade humana; nas sociedades que perderam as virtudes guerreiras e para quem o estrangeiro não é, como para as sociedades sãs, essencialmente o Inimigo — nessas sociedades os governantes perderam o contacto instintivo com a massa do povo, e não podem portanto interpretar o que não sentem. Podem ser homens pessoalmente honestos e bem intencionados; em geral não o são; mas não se pode interpretar os instintos dos outros.\\nComo há-de um governante interpretar um instinto de que não participa? Os governantes não nascem Shakespeares, com a arte de interpretar os sentimentos dos outros; só têm, querendo os deuses, o poder de interpretar os próprios.\\nA democracia é um sistema político que só aparece nas decadências. Quando uma sociedade sente instintivamente que lhe falta a coesão, espontaneamente tenta substituir a coesão por instinto por uma coesão por voto.\\n— Resta saber como se pode criar uma opinião pública sã e activa.\\nÉ infecunda toda a acção política que tenda a criar uma opinião capaz de se manifestar pelo voto; é infecunda toda a acção política que tenda a criar uma opinião capaz de se definir como política. Por isso só é fecunda uma acção política que crie opinião indirectamente, isto é, não tentando criar opinião para que essa opinião se manifeste, mas apenas para que ela exista.\\nPela doutrina democrática, mandar é obedecer. Pela verdadeira doutrina, mandar é compreender (mandar é orientar (no)) (mandar é interpretar).\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nA que leva a moral excessiva? A três resultados todos eles antimorais, porque anti-humanos.\\nPondo a beleza moral no excesso torna essência do acto concebido como belo e valioso o excesso, e assim facilita que, num espírito cruel, a crueldade máxima seja considerada, não direi moral, mas bela.\\nPondo a beleza moral na quebra da harmonia, que o excesso representa, desabitua o espírito a pensar de acordo com a realidade e com a condeterminação das coisas, estultificando a sua actividade, e levando-o à prática de actos «morais» que nem servem aos outros, nem servem a si próprio.\\nPrejudicando a harmonia, prejudica a própria bondade, porque a bondade útil, a verdadeira bondade, que vê o que faz e a quem o faz (para que, errando, não erre o próprio fim caritivo), depende mais de um estado de espírito propenso à suavidade e à não-precipitação, que, por certo, a um estado de espírito propenso ao excesso. Assim, a moral do excesso prejudica os próprios princípios, em virtude dos quais foi criada.\\nA moral é um produto da sociabilidade humana. Dar-lhe um sentido que transcenda a humanidade é tirá-la de casa, é dar-lhe um papel que não tem, é submetê-la a influências que, por estranhas à sua índole, fatalmente a corromperão.\\nPorque são inumanos, os sistemas subjectivistas são, portanto, imorais. Buda e Cristo são símbolos da corrupção da humanidade. Se algum princípio abstracto quisermos que eles representem, diremos que representam o Mal.\\nPodemos perguntar ao Budista, e com mais facilidade ao Cristão, por que é que um Deus concebido como bom criou um mundo mau? ou, pelo menos, um mundo onde há o mal, e, tratando-se de princípios absolutos, onde não há o Bem absoluto, há o Mal absoluto. Nem o Cristão nem o Budista encontraram nunca resposta para esta velha pergunta, que lhes foi sempre, de resto, erroneamente feita.\\nPorque este mundo imperfeito foi-nos dado por esse Criador, na hipótese criativa. Sendo-nos dado assim imperfeito para nós vivermos nele, porque não concluem os budistas e os cristãos que Deus quis que nos adaptássemos às condições deste mundo imperfeito? Para quê dar-nos este mundo, se o que há de bom nele é sair dele? Se o bem é a conformação com Deus, e, em um sistema ou no outro, a identificação, ou com Deus ou com os seus fins, porque é que, tendo-nos dado Deus este mundo, para nós vivermos nele, não consistirá o nosso bem, o que é o bem para nós, na conformação com o mundo que esse Deus nos deu? Porque este mundo ostensivo ou é a própria substância divina revelada a nós, ou é um efeito da Causa divina. Se é a própria substância divina, a nossa adaptação às leis do mundo é a conformação à natureza divina, é portanto o Bem; porque, evidentemente, a conformar-nos com a Natureza Divina, devemos conformar-nos com aquela forma de natureza divina, pela qual Deus se nos revelou, e Deus revela-se-nos como o Universo. Assim, seguindo a hipótese budista, chegamos à moral pagã da mesma maneira. Tão certo é que todos os caminhos levam à verdade, se nunca esquecemos que é para a verdade que queremos ir! Mas, levando para a verdade, leva, ao mesmo tempo, para fora do budismo.\\nVejamos a outra hipótese. Suponha-se que o mundo não é Deus, mas efeito de Deus, estranho à substância divina. Não discutamos agora a estranheza da tese; admitamo-lsa, discutindo os resultados. Se Deus criou este mundo para que vivamos nele, este mundo é o fim que Deus teve, porque, se o não é, é apenas um meio para um fim; ora, na Causa Absoluta, forçosamente o meio há-de ser idêntico ao fim, por isso que só para quem existe em relação a qualquer coisa é que o meio é uma coisa e o fim outra. Sendo, pois, o mundo o fim que Deus teve, a conformação com as leis desse mundo é a conformação com as leis da finalidade divina. Chegamos ao mesmo ponto.\\nA estes dois contra-argumentos, há só uma resposta possível. É a de que não há semelhança entre nós e Deus e que nós não compreendemos Deus; não sabendo qual a sua finalidade e o género de acção divina, diferente infinitamente da nossa. Os caminhos de Deus são escuros, diz a Bíblia; é isso. Seja. Se, porém, o conceito de finalidade é uma coisa em Deus, e para a acção divina, é outra coisa para nós, quem nos diz que Deus tem qualquer moral? Se é diferente, deve ser inteiramente diferente, além do bem e do mal, fora de tudo quanto para nós constitui bem e mal. Nesse caso - dado que o nosso critério moral não deva ser de um inteiro agnosticismo ético - a querermos fazer o bem, devemos imitar Deus, e, se o bem divino é a conformação de Deus com a sua própria natureza, o nosso bem deve ser a nossa conformação com a nossa própria natureza. Chegamos ao mesmo ponto sempre.\\n\\nSuponha-se o dualismo criacionista dos cristãos.\\nO Bem será sempre a conformidade com a vontade divina.\\nA vontade divina criou o mundo. A conformidade com a vontade divina é portanto a conformidade com o mundo.\\nPode dizer-se: a vontade divina criou na verdade o mundo; mas criou-o para um fim que não está no mundo. Passe o absurdo da tese; admitamo-la, e discutamos, perante ela, o assunto que discutimos.\\nO fim com que Deus criou o mundo não prejudica que o Bem seja a conformação com a vontade divina; neste caso será com o fim com que Deus criou o mundo. Ora o fim com que Deus criou o mundo ou está contido na substância desse mundo, ou não está. Se está, a conformação com a vontade divina está na conformação. Se o mundo não é o fim da vontade divina, só pode ser o meio para esse fim. Deixemos de parte a primeira objecção, que seria perguntar se para uma Vontade Absoluta o fim pode ser distinto do meio. Admitamos a tese absurda. Como nós pertencemos ao mundo, pertencemos ao meio de que Deus se serviu para realizar um fim; a nossa conformidade com a vontade divina é portanto em obedecer ao papel que Deus nos deu. Se nos fez parte do meio de que se serviu para um fim, sermos o mais possível conformes com esse meio é o único modo que temos de sermos o mais possível conformes com o fim que Deus teve e para que se serve deste meio; porque conformar-nos com o fim que Deus teve, à parte o não podermos saber qual ele seja, seria, neste caso, sermos Deus. Ora, neste sistema, dualista, o homem não pode ser Deus. Por isso ou caímos no sistema emanacionista dos budistas, cuja estultificação ética vimos, ou caímos na moral da conformação com as leis do universo.\\nSeja qual for o lado para onde nos viremos, encontramos a moral objectivista. Ora, se essa moral pertence ao sistema objectivista, e é a única moral que podemos descobrir como boa, como não aceitar que é o sistema objectivista o que representa a verdade, e o paganismo, manifestação do sistema objectivista, a religião verdadeira?\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE [b]\\n',\n",
       "  'text': \"\\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE \\n\\nAt first sight it seems that something of Whitman is present in these poems. I have no information as to Caeiro's knowledge of foreign languages, or of English and of Whitman particularly; yet, on the face of it, and after a very cursory reading of the poems, I suspect the first to have been, at best, very slight, and the second and third nil. However it may be, on close examination there is really no influence of Whitman here. There is at most an occasional coincidence and the coincidence is merely of tone, and more apparent therefore than real. The essential difference is enormous.\\nThe traits common to the two poets are the love of Nature and simplicity, and the astounding acuity of sensation. But, whereas Whitman insistently reads transcendental meanings into Nature, nothing can be further from Caeiro's attitude than that; it is, as a matter of fact, the exact opposite to this attitude. And whereas Whitman's sensations are immensely various and include both natural and artificial, and the metaphysical as well as the physical, Caeiro's persistently exclude even the more «natural artificial» things and are only metaphysical in that extremely peculiar negative manner which is one of the novelties of his attitude.\\nAgain, Caeiro has a perfectly definite and coherent philosophy. It may not be as coherent in word and phrase as might be wished from a philosopher; but he is not a philosopher, but a poet. It may not be coherent from the outset, but it grows more and more definite as we read on till, in the final poems of the Keeper of Sheep, it takes a definite and unmistakable shape. It is a quite perfectly defined absolute objectivism — the completest system of absolute objectivism which we have ever had, either from philosopher or from writer. There is philosophy in Whitman, but it is the philosophy of a poet and not of a thinker; and where there is\\nphilosophy it is not of an original cast, the sentiment alone being original. Not so in Caeiro, in whom both thought and feeling are altogether novel.\\nFinally, though both are «sensationists», Caeiro's sensationism is of a type different from Whitman's. The difference, though it seems subtle and difficult to explain, is nevertheless quite clear. It lies chiefly in this: Caeiro seizes on a single subject and sees it clearly; even when he seems to see it in a complex way, it will be found that is but some means to see it all the more clearly. Whitman strives to see, not clearly, but deeply. Caeiro sees only the object, striving to separate it as much as possible from all other objects and from all sensations or ideas not, so to speak, part of the object itself. Whitman does the exact contrary: he strives to link up the object with all others, with many others, with the soul and the Universe and God.\\nLastly, the very temperaments of the two poets differ. Even when he thinks, Whitman's thought is a mode of his feeling, or absolutely a mood, in the common decadent sense. Even when Caeiro feels, his feeling is a mode of this thought.\\nThis description of their differences might be prolonged indefinitely. Whitman's violent democratic feeling could be contrasted with Caeiro's abhorrence for any sort of humanitarianism, Whitman's interest in all things human, with Caeiro's indifference to all that men feel, suffer or enjoy.\\nAfter all, and all things considered, when we eliminate the superficial resemblance derived from nonrhythmical character of the poetry of both men, and the abstract revolt against civilization, the resemblances between them are exhausted.\\nBesides, Whitman has really a sense of metrical rhythm; it is of a special kind, but it exists. Caeiro's rhythm is noticeably absent. He is so distinctly intellectual, that the lines have no wave of feeling from which to derive their rhythmical movement.\\nWhat after all is Caeiro's value, his message to us, as the phrase goes? It is not difficult to determine. To a world plunged in various kinds of subjectivisms, he brings Absolute Objectivism more absolute than the pagan objectivists ever had it. To a World over-civilized he brings Absolute Nature back again. To a world merged in humanitarisms, in workers' problems, in ethical societies, in social movements, he brings an absolute contempt for the fate and the life of man, which, if it be thought excessive, is at last natural to him and a magnificent corrective. Wordsworth had opposed natural man to artificial man; «natural man» is for Caeiro as artificial as anything else except Nature.\\nOur first impression of Caeiro is that everybody knows that he tells us, that there is therefore no need to say it. But it is the old story of Columbus’ egg. If everybody knows this, why has no one said it? If not worth saying, but true, why has every poet said the contrary?\\n\",\n",

Se pelos seus instintos individuais um homem se define para si próprio como em oposição aos outros homens, e portanto como diferente deles, pelos seus instintos sociais, ao contrário, define-se como em colaboração com eles, e portanto como seu semelhante. Os instintos propriamente sociais são, pois, aqueles pelos quais um indivíduo se sente semelhante de outro indivíduo da mesma sociedade, por divergentes que sejam as suas actividades, e antagónicos que sejam os seus temperamentos. E os instintos primordialmente, fundamentalmente sociais serão aqueles pelos quais um indivíduo se sente semelhante do maior número possível de indivíduos da sociedade a que pertence.\\nA vida social, vimos, é essencialmente acção. Ora a mais simples, natural e vulgar de todas as acções é a de falar. A identidade que se sente através da conversa é portanto a mais profunda, a mais insistente, a mais quotidiana de todas. Por isso a que mais funda e imediatamente nos faz sentir-nos semelhantes de outro homem é o facto de ele falar a mesma língua que nós. Sentimos mais próximo e semelhante, por instinto, um estrangeiro que fale perfeitamente a nossa língua, que um nacional que, por qualquer razão, a ignore.

As lendas crististas sobre santos e práticos do bem não contêm elementos diferentes.\\nOra qual é a substância da beleza - beleza moral, é claro - que se pode encontrar nesta lenda? Trata-se de um sentimento, o de compaixão, levado ao seu auge. Por compaixão pelo bicho vítima, o Buda o livra do verme; por compaixão pelo verme, o Buda lhe dá a sua própria carne a comer. A compaixão - note-se - é por um bicho e por um verme, entes inferiores na escala animal. E o que dá de comer é um pedaço da sua própria carne. Aqui a compaixão excessiva chega a um auge, sobre o seu auge, porque a compaixão leva ao sacrifício doloroso.\\nOra qual é, dizia, a substância da beleza moral contida nesta lenda? É simplesmente um sentimento excessivo tornado ainda mais excessivo pela forma da execução. Isto é, consiste a beleza moral desta lenda no facto de um excesso ser levado a um excesso. Ora tudo quanto é excessivo representa uma ruptura de harmonia; quanto seja excessivo sobre excessivo representa uma dupla ruptura de harmonia. Temos, pois, que esta moral envolve como princípio, a ruptura de harmonia.\\nSei bem que o budista me pode responder que, segundo o seu princípio religioso, por esse acto de bondade e de sacrifício, o Buda, longe de romper uma harmonia, estabeleceu-a, restabeleceu uma harmonia rupta pela ilusão do mundo; porque (para o budista) sendo o Ser só um, tudo quanto tende para o fazer reverter à unidade tende para a harmonia, e a bondade, pelo mero facto de aproximar dois seres, tende para a unidade. Assim o Buda, longe de ter rompido uma harmonia, te-la-ia, ao contrário, restabelecido.\\nÉ a maior objecção que se pode fazer ao meu argumento; e é o budista, não o cristão, que a pode fazer. Escasseia ao cristão qualquer argumento aparentemente tão eficaz.\\nSe, porém, aplicarmos uma análise atilada a esta resposta, veremos que ela se dissolve em ar. Para se mostrar quão absoluta é a ruptura de harmonia, concedamos o princípio, que já sabemos absurdo, de que o universo é uma ilusão, e de que tudo é Um no ser uno e superinfinito. Nesse ser uno há porém esta dualidade, apenas aparente neste sistema, mas, seja aparente, dualidade: o ser uno verdadeiro, e o ser múltiplo fictício. A harmonia pode consistir, neste sistema em três coisas: harmonia do ser uno em si próprio, harmonia do ser fictício em si próprio, harmonia de um com outro. O segundo caso está excluído, pois que, perante a vida do universo ostensivo, a ruptura de harmonia é patente.\\n\\nOra, desde que o culto do excessivo é insinuado à alma humana como identificado com o culto da moral, quem nos diz que esse culto não será aplicado a coisas imorais? Quem nos diz que almas baixas e reles o não aplicarão em proveito das suas faculdades inferiores?\\nNinguém, e de feito é o que acontece.\\n\\nO culto do excessivo, sobre abrir as portas a todos os desmandos e a todos os vícios, prejudica o próprio fim moral. Porque a moral excessiva é a menos útil à humanidade, pois que os actos morais que produz são (…)\\n',\n",

This is one of the cases in which there is the excuse of necessity. The great poet whom I present to the English reading public — rather more attentive to poetry than it recently had fallen off from being — belongs to a literature of which we know less than the classic next-to-nothing. And this miserly bit of knowledge of that literature is merely that Camões is its greatest poet, — a statement which, though it is controvertible and has been controverted, has at least the appearance of supposing knowledge of other poets, when, after all, it only means that we are more or less sure there must be others.\\nThe ordinary presentation of Alberto Caeiro to the English public should, in this literary connection, mean an establishing of his relation to immediately preceding literature in his country, and an establishing of such of his influences as are outside the normal, or even abnormal, knowledge of that public. But being so, this is in the present case entirely the contrary. The curious fact about Alberto Caeiro is that he comes apparently out of nothing, more completely out of nothing than any other poet. The one Portuguese poet whose influence he supposes himself to be under is so remote from him both in quality and strength of inspiration, that it is idle to do more than say so.\\nBut we will not limit our brief study of Caeiro to seaking of his influences; we will push our study further and summon the reader's attention gently to the absolute aspects of the present book as poetry of national and other relational connections. \\n\",\n",

       "  'text': '\\nDemonstrado, assim, que a Democracia moderna é radicalmente anti-social, pois que um dos seus princípios fundamentais, o do sufrágio político, é substancialmente antagónico, por “intelectual”, ao não intelectualismo que caracteriza as manifestações do instintivismo social e da chamada “opinião pública”, base [...] de toda a vida política, resta, neste capítulo, que provemos que a Democracia moderna é por igual antipopular e antipatriótica. A demonstração far-se-á contrapondo o segundo dos princípios democráticos, o liberalismo, ao segundo dos princípios do instintivismo social, a conservatividade; e contrapondo o terceiro dos princípios democráticos, o pacifismo, ao terceiro dos princípios do instintivismo social, que é o antagonismo. Assim se provará, no primeiro caso, a antipopularidade da Democracia moderna, e, no segundo caso, o seu antipatriotismo.\\nAo comparar os princípios liberais, ou liberalistas, com a essência conservativa do instintivismo social, temos que, logo de início, excluir uma possibilidade de erro, que é a que resultaria de se confundir conservatividade com conservantismo. Quando tivermos que considerar a opinião pública como fenómeno sempre tradicionalista (o que já provámos que era) será ocasião de encarar o problema do conservantismo, propriamente tal. O que nos preocupa agora, na análise comparativa do liberalismo da democracia moderna e da conservatividade do instintivismo social, é a definição diferencial dessa conservatividade. E, como o nome sugere conservantismo por semelhança etimológica, cumpre, antes de mais nada, distinguir.\\nQuando, no anterior artigo, determinámos quais os característicos fundamentais do instinto, e, portanto da opinião pública (que havíamos provado ser uma soma de instintos e não uma soma [?] de ideias), notámos que um desses característicos do instinto era a sua conservatividade, e por esse termo designávamos a peculiaridade do instinto em não se adaptar, contraposta à contrária peculiaridade da inteligência, de ser essencialmente adaptativa.\\nA conservatividade entende-se, portanto, como sendo aquela peculiaridade do instinto pela qual ele tende a conservar-se tal qual é, procurando, ante qualquer fenómeno externo, adaptá-lo a si, e não adaptar-se [a si] a ele. Resulta desta peculiaridade que se há tendência fundamental do instinto é a de fazer com que todas as coisas, com as quais se encontra, se convertam na sua própria substância, dele, instinto. Ora esta atitude dá como resultado nos indivíduos componentes da camada instintiva, e portanto sã, de uma nação, o egoísmo como fenómeno distintivo. O que na generalidade do instinto se caracteriza por a tendência não adaptativa, caracteriza-se na particularidade individual do instinto pela tendência centrípeta. Ora, como são as camadas populares (como vimos) as que concentram em si o instintivismo social, as que são depositárias do instinto de sociedade, segue que essas camadas são por igual depositárias do egoísmo como determinação individual desse fenómeno geral. E segue imediatamente que para uma teoria ser antipopular, basta que seja antiegoística. Basta que se lance para o seio de uma sociedade uma teoria, pela qual se ataque o egoísmo, para se lançar uma teoria pela qual se ataca o povo.\\nHá, evidentemente, uma excepção; esse egoísmo nasce da espontânea aplicação particular do instintivismo social, mas esse instintivismo social tem como base o sentimento patriótico. Resulta que o sentimento patriótico e o egoísmo individual têm a mesma base instintiva, mas, nados da mesma raiz psíquica, São os termos equilibradores. O homem normal só deixa de ser egoísta ante um apelo ao seu sentimento patriótico; o instinto familiar, que normalmente condiciona o egoísmo, é apenas uma extensão quase física desse egoísmo, como aliás o é o próprio patriotismo.\\nSendo isto assim, não custa a ver que o princípio liberalista, ou igualitário, inteiramente se contrapõe ao egoísmo são dos homens. Busca o liberalismo a abolição de privilégios, a abolição de diferenças entre os homens; e leva isto mais ou menos longe, teoricamente, consoante a ousadia ou indisciplina mental dos teorizadores e praticamente consoante a perturbação social que se atravesse.\\nA abolição de privilégios, parece, a princípio, que deve ser concordante com o egoísmo natural dos homens, pois que a abolição do privilégio de um homem pode favorecer o egoísmo de mil homens; e se há aqui egoísmo ferido, é só o egoísmo do desprivilegiado [...]\\nAo destruir privilégios, o liberalismo parte de um princípio falso, porque antiegoísta. Parte do princípio de que o privilégio é um estorvo, e não de que ele é uma vantagem; isto é, encara o privilégio do lado dos desprivilegiados, e não do lado dos privilegiados. Fazendo isto, o liberalismo encara o privilégio do lado antiegoísta. Encara o privilégio como uma coisa que não deve haver. Se fosse uma doutrina socialmente sã, devia encará-lo como uma coisa que devia haver em mais abundância, visto que, para\\nquem o tem, é uma vantagem. O erro está nisto, e tanto é um erro, que a grande época democrática chamada a Idade Média tinha a opinião contrária; o próprio povo, cioso então dos seus direitos como nunca depois o foi, tinha essa ideia.\\nNa Idade Média usava-se a palavra liberdade, como hoje, mas com o sentido oposto ao que hoje se usa. O povo medieval considerava a liberdade como um privilégio concedido, não como a ausência de um privilégio nos outros (Quote Pollard).\\nQualquer citação de uma autoridade competente pode servir para autenticar esta asserção. Como quaisquer outras, serve a palavra seguinte, do prof. A. W. Pollard, na sua Short History of England (p.53):... \\nPode o povo — sobretudo se foi oprimido — simpatizar a princípio com o movimento liberalista; mas tarde ou cedo, de desconfiar dele, passa a odiá-lo, porque, ou o liberalismo segue o seu caminho lógico e justo, e então mais tarde ou mais cedo entra em conflito com privilégios que a ele, povo, tocam já de perto; pequenos privilégios todos os têm, mais ou menos [...]; ou, que é o que em geral acontece, o liberalismo, por ser um absurdo sociológico e, portanto, encontrar atritos por toda a parte para a sua operação, gradualmente se vai desviando e vem a ser uma mera arma de espoliação, simultaneamente útil como isco para os idiotas e anzol para os objectos da cobiça. Mero implemento de ladrões, o liberalismo acaba por despertar as iras do povo; e se não as despertou antes, é que o povo, como é ignorante, não sabe o que é aquilo, ou que perigos lhe traz.\\nAssim, sendo antiegoísta, o liberalismo é antipopular. Para se ser “liberal” é preciso ser-se inimigo do povo, não ter contactos nenhuns com a alma popular [...] Teoria, de resto arranjada por aristocratas ingleses como arma contra a velha monarquia, e por homens de letras franceses mais como arma contra a Igreja que contra o ancien régime, sua própria origem proclama impossível a sua popularidade. Feito por quem, ou não era povo ou não podia sentir como povo, não admira que esse sistema venha eivado de todos os vícios anti-instintivistas, de todas as raivas antipopulares.\\nO assunto comportaria uma série muito mais extensa de observações, entre as quais a menos interessante não seria, por certo, a demonstração de que o povo é naturalmente aristocratista, de que nunca um povo foi espontaneamente democrático, de que nunca o povo defendeu, de seu, senão os seus egoísmos, e a sua pátria; nunca, nunca, excepto por perversão imposta, ou perversão da decadência, os seus “direitos”, as suas “justiças” foram assunto por que o homem do povo fizesse [?] o esforço do levantar de um braço ou de tirar as mãos das algibeiras.\\n\\nConsideremos agora a oposição, mais fácil de determinar, entre o instintivismo social, no seu característico antagonismo, e a Democracia Moderna, no seu pacifismo característico.\\nO patriotismo, vimos nós e demonstrámos, é a base do instinto social — é, mesmo o único instinto social verdadeiro; não é, de resto, mais que um egoísmo colectivo, ou, melhor, a forma colectiva do egoísmo, base de toda a vida psíquica. Demonstrámos também que, ao contrário da inteligência, que busca compreender, e, pois que o busca, não pode odiar o que compreende, o instinto odeia tudo quanto não seja ele, que o instinto é, portanto, radicalmente antagonista. No campo individual isto dá a ânsia da concorrência, a tendência constante para esmagar e entravar o esforço alheio (no que individual) que é a base da vida da humanidade, a causa dolorosa de toda a civilização. Se o amor é a fonte de toda a vida individual, o ódio é a fonte de toda a vida social. E do ódio entre homem e homem que a civilização nasce, e não só do ódio entre homem e homem, como do ódio entre nação e nação. No campo colectivo, o egoísmo tornado nacionalismo espontaneamente odeia o estrangeiro; todo o estrangeiro, para um povo são, é o seu inimigo. A expressão vulgar «uma nação amiga», quando não seja uma amabilidade [...], como o «atento venerador e obrigado» da correspondência comercial, é um crime sociológico; há só uma nação amiga, é a própria; só há uma nação que estimamos como nação, é a nossa. O resto é lixo de teorias.\\n«A guerra», disse Heraclito, «é a mãe de todas as coisas.» E assim é. Maldade e corrupção humana? pecado original pesando sobre a estirpe dos homens? Seja o que for, assim é, e por certo a tese cristã da maldade fundamental dos homens tem mais base que a tese liberalista da sua bondade fundamental.\\nContrapusemos, assim, sucessivamente aos três princípios fundamentais do instintivismo social, base de toda a saúde das colectividades e das nações, os três princípios fundamentais do fenómeno de baixo intelectualismo chamado a Democracia moderna. Vimos que à não intelectualidade do instintivismo se opunha a pseudo-intelectualidade do princípio do sufrágio, e que, assim, e por esse seu princípio, a Democracia moderna é anti-social. Vimos que à conservatividade do instintivismo se opunha o pseudo-altruísmo nivelador do liberalismo, e que, assim, e por esse seu princípio, a Democracia moderna é antipopular. Vimos que ao antagonismo do instintivismo social se opunha o pacifismo fraternitário, e que, assim, e por esse seu princípio, a Democracia moderna é antinacional e antipatriótica.\\nE assim demonstrámos que a análise escrupulosa do que seja a opinião pública, e de quais as bases psíquicas de uma vida social sã leva inevitavelmente ao esfrangalhamento integral do conceito moderno de Democracia.\\nCumpre juntar a estas considerações só mais uma, tendente a esclarecer o aparecimento nesta análise de urna condicionação constante. Dissemos sempre “Democracia moderna”. Assim dissemos porque “Democracia” de per si, comporta dois outros sentidos: podia entender-se, sem este escrúpulo nosso, que o nosso argumento se entendia também com a Democracia antiga dos pagãos, sistema muito diferente, e solidamente assente na dupla base da servidão e do aristocracismo — dupla aristocratização social; e podia entender-se que o nosso argumento implicava com a democracia monárquica (tal na verdade foi) da Idade Média que, por bárbara é excluída destas considerações, e por sã alheia a elas.\\nResta, agora, que demonstremos a segunda parte da nossa tese primária. Vimos já o que se podia deduzir de ser a opinião pública um instinto; vamos ver agora o que se pode deduzir de ser a opinião pública (como demonstrámos) sempre tradicionalista.\\nAs sociedades vivem (como demonstrámos em o nosso artigo “Como Organizar Portugal”) pelo equilíbrio de duas forças — a força conservadora, ou tradicionalista e a força progressiva ou antitradicionalista. No nosso artigo “C[omo] O[rganizar] P[ortugal]“ assim o provámos; mas em verdade não houve necessidade de provas[...]\\nSe a opinião pública é sempre tradicionalista, segue que a opinião pública é sempre oposta ao progresso, segue também que as forças progressivas da sociedade, sobre trabalharem sempre em oposição à opinião pública, isto é, o instinto social, se acha naturalmente localizado.\\nVejamos o conteúdo lógico de cada uma destas duas conclusões.\\nQue a opinião pública é sempre oposta ao progresso, é facto dos mais fácil e universalmente constatados pela história e pela experiência. A função social da opinião pública, como tal, é resistir ao progresso, mas, como ao progresso se não pode resistir, a função resume-se, por fim, em equilibrar a velocidade excessiva, que as classes progressivas tendem a imprimir à vida social.\\nComo é que, então, se há-de fazer progredir uma sociedade, se a maioria dessa sociedade se opõe sempre ao progresso? A pergunta, que parece natural, envolve um erro, e no esclarecimento desse erro, ou mal-entendido, vai a solução verdadeira do problema. Para fazer progredir a sociedade os dirigentes têm evidentemente que contrariar os instintos conservadores da opinião pública, propriamente tal. Mas a opinião pública, se, a princípio, recebe sempre mal as inovações, como tais, deixa de as receber mal quando elas obedeçam a uma de três condições possíveis:\\nOs progressos que não envolvem conflito com as tradições nacionais, evidentemente que não ferem a opinião pública profundamente. O estabelecimento de vias férreas, por exemplo, ainda que, por ser novidade, excitasse fortemente contra ele a opinião pública (como nos célebres discursos no parlamento britânico, e no procedimento inimigo de tantas populações pela Europa fora) não feriu senão um hábito — o hábito de estas inovações não existirem —, não atacou instinto tradicional nenhum. Este género de inovações, quando a opinião verifica que são úteis — o que é fácil que verifique — e quando manifestamente não firam as suas tradições, pertencem à esfera legítima do governo. Aqui podem os dirigentes inovar à vontade, que governam legitimamente. E assim com todas as coisas de índole administrativa, em cuja natureza não está ferirem as tradições nacionais.\\nNeste ponto portanto — no ponto administrativo — podem as classes progressivas fazer o que quiserem, que não encontraram obstáculo real no conservantismo são e legítimo do povo. O povo nem compreende as fórmulas e regras administrativas, nem a aplicação delas, salvo em casos de grande amplitude reformadora, atinge o conservantismo popular.\\nNo campo de política interna, já a questão se não passa da mesma maneira. Há períodos da vida nacional em que se torna preciso adoptar medidas que vão com certeza alterar costumes assentes, que chocarão portanto o conservantismo popular. A medida do estadista está em saber fazer estas reformas sem sobressaltar e sem levantar a si próprio atritos. Os “estadistas” de mentalidade revolucionária, que resolvem os problemas eliminando um dos termos, estabelecem sempre contra si a reacção conservadora (que sobe do povo às classes dirigentes mais ligadas a ele — como às classes agrárias, que eram pelo Rei contra o Parlamento na guerra civil inglesa), e como no caso recente da reacção sidonista, contra a imperícia democrática. Nenhum problema político deve ser resolvido de acordo com a opinião popular, porque a opinião popular é sempre de opinião que o que está é que está bem. Mas nenhum problema político deve ser resolvido contra a opinião popular, porque tal solução, não sendo adaptável pelo instinto do povo, queda nula nos seus efeitos nacionais\\n— como a separação da igreja e do estado decretada por Costa, que não fez mais que avivar a fé católica em Portugal, resultado que, por certo, aquele pseudo-estadista não procurou.\\nOs estadistas de primeira ordem, como Bismarck ou Cromwell, governaram sempre contra a opinião pública. Os estadistas de segunda ordem, como Napoleão, governaram sempre com ela.\\nO conservantismo faz com que não haja nunca indicações positivas de opinião pública; a opinião pública nunca pede que, pede sempre que não. (Faquet.)\\nNão há movimentos revolucionários nacionais, a valer, senão contra o estrangeiro, ou contra-revolucionários de dentro. Só há contra-revoluções nacionais, não revoluções.\\n',\n",

Pareceria, \\n\\na priori, \\n\\nque poemas sem ritmo nem rima deviam não poder [dar] uma impressão de conjuntos perfeitos. Não é isto que acontece com os poemas de Caeiro. Parecem traduções para linguagem humana de poemas escritos no idioma dos Deuses, que na versão conservam o divino equilíbrio, a divina calma, a unidade sobre-humana de obras de imortais.\\n\\nEm cada verso reside a despreocupação das nossas coisas passageiras, um curioso e original [var.: estranho e novo] desprezo do transitório, obtido por um ascetismo estético e não moral; à grega antiga, os olhos postos na beleza que não passa e esquecendo em ela o mundo contingente e volúvel.\\nÉ, outra vez, verdadeiramente vivo, em carne, o ideal dos gregos da antiga Hélade. Novamente fitam olhos olímpicos o variado espectáculo do mundo. Novamente uma noção da beleza se forma, que nada tem com a moral, mas que não é formal, como o são todos os pretensos imoralismos modernos, obra eunuca de «estetas» de fingimento — Wildes, Gautiers, e outros assim, que tinham da antiguidade uma noção artificial e mesquinha.\\nOs numerosos erros em que temos sido educados por o exemplo de gerações passadas fazem com que seja muito difícil uma reformação do paganismo. O homem, que deseja levar os modernos pela mão, outra vez pelo caminho do Olimpo, tem, não só que desviá-los da senda cristã, o que já é difícil, mas também tirá-los daqueles falsos atalhos e cursos desviados por onde os têm conduzido os pretendidos [var.: pretensos] renovadores ou sequazes do velho espírito pagão. Quanto em nossos dias se tem dito sobre o paganismo peca por formal por não atingir, para além das aparências do paganismo, o seu íntimo espírito vivo.\\nTrês foram as interpretações modernas do paganismo; tantos foram os erros sobre o espírito pagão. Primeiro, houve os homens do renascimento italiano, que não viram no paganismo senão o seu amor pela beleza física, e o seu culto pela perfeição formal. Vieram depois, numa degeneração de esses, os homens secos e estreitos que constituíram aquilo a que se chama o «espírito clássico» — e estes do paganismo só viram a perfeição formal, o culto da perfeição; esquecendo já, porque de ordinário eram espíritos verdadeiramente cristãos, o culto da beleza em que essoutro assentava, de que ele não era, verdadeiramente, senão uma parte. De aí a seca e estéril legião dos homens que deram, durante longos anos, leis literárias ao mundo. De aí os Petrarcas e [...] De aí a plebe estética dos Boileau, odiosa para sempre. Em seu medíocre [...] francês, tomaram por norma um equilíbrio, uma racionalidade vazia; não cuidando de que, para os antigos, tal equilíbrio, tal medida fora, não uma coisa definida, uma primeira regra da estética, porém um limite, um freio posto à íntima e desordenada exuberância que há em todo o sentimento da beleza. Não viam que a perfeição não é a beleza, senão uma parte dela; que a fronteira não é a nação, mas o que a define como tal.\\nNão menos estreita e falsa se bem que de outro modo [...] é a ideia moderna do paganismo, que devemos aos esforços mal-empregados de uma seita de artistas que começa com Gautier e achou o seu maior representante [?] na pessoa de Óscar Wilde. Aqui o género de erro é outro.\\nUm Wilde é, na realidade, tão estreito e seco como um Boileau. Hoje, é difícil vê-lo, mas o futuro longínquo [?] não deixará de notá-lo. Todo o espírito que nasceu pagão o nota imediatamente.\\nC[aeiro]: os últimos versos: Alguns deles eu, de boa vontade, não publicaria. São de um espírito já enfermo em que subrepticiamente a individualidade é traída por si mesma [var.: própria].\\nUm pensamento pensado ao rubro, e depois deixado esfriar na mente até que se lhe possa dar forma e contorno.\\nNão quero dizer que os gregos pensassem como românticos e executassem como estatuários. Não havia, não podia haver, essa duplicidade no seu espírito. A acção de conceber e de executar era já assim no espírito. O modo de conceber uma obra de arte é já o modo de executá-la.\\n',\n",

As condições (tristes) mentais do nosso meio moderno inflingiram ao espírito científico um desvio. Como a ciência teve que atacar a Igreja, ao mesmo tempo que a «democracia» a teve que atacar, resultou, naturalmente, que as duas forças se uniram contra a Igreja, de onde se deduziu, erroneamente, que havia qualquer espécie de identidade entre o espírito científico e o democrático, quando o mais que houve, na verdade, foi uma coincidência no inimigo.\\nA ciência, porém, é antidemocrática e anti-igualitária. A ciência social é a última a constituir-se, porque os fenómenos sociais, sobre serem os mais complexos, são envolventes do observador e a série de preconceitos, que incidem sobre o cientista, são neste caso mais e maiores que noutro ponto científico.\\nNem a ciência é anti-religiosa; é simplesmente extra-religiosa. A religião é um fenómeno comum a todas as classes sociais, e que a todas liga e une. A ciência, fenómeno intelectual, é apanágio só das classes intelectuais. Não pode ser praticada, nem mesmo compreendida, no seu vero espírito, pelas plebes; estas, de resto, se a compreendessem deixariam de ser plebes, e, com deixarem de o ser, perigaria a civilização, assim desprovida de base.\\nO que modernamente há a fazer é trabalhar para uma religião que esteja de acordo com o espírito da ciência; e que religião há-de ser senão aquela a quem a ciência deve a sua nascença, porque Minerva é filha de Zeus, e a ciência toda nada do paganismo helénico.\\nSó a ciência «democrática» do século passado, antes de haver ciência social, é que é fria e dura, por se arrogar uma missão estranha ao seu espírito, e por querer destruir a religião, que jaz fora do seu vero âmbito.\\nAo passo que a ciência é uma forma de conhecimento, pela qual o homem opera sobre a matéria, a religião é uma forma de conhecimento pela qual ele opera sobre si próprio.

Segundo o meu processo de sentir as coisas sem as sentir, fui-me deixando ir na onda dessa reacção momentânea. Quando reparei em que estava pensando, vi que tinha erguido uma teoria neoclássica, e que a ia desenvolvendo. Achei-a bela e calculei interessante se a desenvolvesse segundo princípios que não adopto nem aceito.

Digo que são amigos, porque são - ambas as coisas - sentimentos de feição altruísta. Digo que bastas vezes se desavêm, porque o que mais custa é querer encarar a verdade em assuntos onde a verdade pode ferir.\\nPrecedo este opúsculo de considerações, como estas, porque vou nele defender uma tese que não só vai contra a opinião da maioria dos meus compatriotas - o que seria de importância mínima -, mas - e é isto que deveras importa - contra os próprios interesses da minha pátria. Como, porém, eu creio que a verdade se deve dizer sempre, escrevo sem hesitação este opúsculo. Ainda se eu julgasse, com estulta incompetência de compreensão, que ele poderia ter qualquer efeito sobre as decisões dos meus compatriotas, talvez o não publicasse. Mas a triste situação, entre nós, dos homens que pensam, de fazer obra inteiramente desaproveitada, fazendo arte sem querer, faz com que me não demore um momento em considerar os inconvenientes de escrever este opúsculo.\\nAlém disso, cumpre que se observe que podemos perfeitamente combater um homem ou uma nação, cuja razão em nos ser inimigo reconhecemos. Por isso eu não peço, nem sugiro sequer, que Portugal seja neutral nesta guerra. De modo algum encaro o problema sobre o ponto de vista português, que é insignificante, deveras, na acção vasta desta guerra. Procuro neste opúsculo justificar a Alemanha, dar-lhe razão nesta guerra; procuro fazê-lo porque estou convencido de que ela tem razão.\\nO meu procedimento é o dum pensador, não o dum patriota. Nenhum homem de pensamento pode proceder como patriota em Portugal contemporâneo. O destino da nossa terra está nas mãos de homens da mentalidade de escravos que se encontram dominadores, de cristãos disfarçados de espíritos libertos, de gente que, do mando, nem sequer tem a clareza de alma para mandar. Nenhum homem superior pode colaborar na obra nacional. O único escrúpulo do português, hoje, deve ser fazer obra para a civilização em geral, tentando a única coisa possível - levantar a sua Pátria no conceito da Europa pelo alevantado dos pensamentos, pelo novo e justo dos conceitos que põem em escrito. Esta obra, por isso, é destinada, não aos portugueses em geral, que a não saberiam compreender, dizendo-a apenas, quiçá, de um espírito vendido à Alemanha; ela destina-se a esclarecer, no espírito de quantos se achem interessados por compreender os problemas que esta guerra levantou, qual seja a significação profunda das forças aparentemente cegas que se degladiam agora na vasta arena do nosso continente.\\nEla não visa a outro fim.\\n',\n",

Cada pessoa é apenas o seu sonho de si-próprio.\\nEu nem isso sou.\\n……\\nNão soube nunca o que sentia. Quando me falavam de tal ou tal emoção e a descreviam, sempre senti que descreviam qualquer coisa da m[inha] alma, mas, depois, pensando, duvidei sempre. O que me sinto ser, nunca sei se o sou realmente, ou se julgo que o sou apenas. Sou uma personagem de dramas meus.\\nO esforço é inútil, mas entretém. O raciocínio é estéril, mas é engraçado. Amar é maçador, mas é talvez preferível a não amar. (O sonho, porém, substitui tudo). Nele pode haver toda a noção do esforço sem o esforço real. Dentro do sonho posso entrar em batalhas sem risco de ter morto ou de ser ferido. Posso raciocinar, sem que tenha em vista chegar a uma verdade, a que nunca chegue; sem querer resolver um problema, que nunca resolvo; sem que (...). Posso amar sem me recusarem nem me trairem, nem me aborrecerem. Posso mudar de amada e ela será sempre a mesma. E se quiser que me traia e se me esquive, tenho às ordens que isso me aconteça, e sempre como eu quero, sempre como eu o gozo. Em sonho posso viver as maiores angústias, as maiores torturas, as maiores vitórias. Posso viver tudo isso tal como se fosse da vida; depende apenas do meu poder em tornar o sonho vivido, nítido, real. Isso exige estudo e paciência interior.\\nHá várias maneiras de sonhar. Uma é abandonar-se aos sonhos, sem procurar torná-los nítidos, deixar-se ir no vago e no crepúsculo das suas sensações. É inferior e cansa, porque esse modo de sonhar é monótono, sempre o mesmo. Há o sonho nítido e dirigido, mas aí o esforço em dirigir o sonho trai o artifício demasiadamente. O artista supremo, o sonhador como eu o sou, tem só o esforço de querer que o sonho seja tal que tome tais caprichos - e ele desenrola-se diante dele assim como ele o desejaria, mas não poderia conceber, sem justificação de fazê-lo. Quero sonhar-me rei... Num acto brusco, quero-o. E eis-me súbito rei dum país qualquer. Qual, de que espécie, o sonho mo dirá... Porque eu cheguei a esta vitória sobre o que sonhar - que os meus sonhos trazem-me sempre inesperadamente o que eu quero. Muitas vezes aperfeiçoo, ao trazê-la nítida, a vida cuja vaga ordem apenas recebera. Eu sou totalmente incapaz de idear conscientemente as Idades Médias de diversas épocas e de diversas Terras que tenho vivido em sonhos. Deslumbra-me o excesso de imaginação que desconhecia em mim e vou vendo. Deixo os sonhos só... Tenho-os tão puros que eles excedem sempre o que eu espero deles. São sempre mais belos do que eu quero. Mas isto só o sonhador aperfeiçoado pode esperar obter. Tenho levado anos a buscar sonhadoramente isto. Hoje consigo-o sem esforço...\\nA melhor maneira de começar a sonhar é mediante livros. Os romances servem de muito para o principiante. Aprender a entregar-se totalmente à leitura, a viver absolutamente com as personagens de um romance - eis o 1º passo. Que a n[ossa] família e as suas imagens nos pareçam chilras e ingratas ao lado dessas, eis o sinal do progresso.\\nÉ preciso evitar o ler romances literários onde a atenção seja desviada para a forma do romance. (...) Não tenho vergonha em confessar que assim comecei. É curioso mas os romances policiais, os (...) [...].\\nNunca pude ler romances amorosos detidamente. Mas isto é uma questão pessoal, por não ter feitio de amoroso, nem mesmo em sonhos. Cada qual cultive, porém, o feitio que tiver. Reconheceremos sempre de que sonhar é procurarmo-nos. O sensual deverá, para suas leituras, escolher as opostas às que forem minhas.\\nQuando a sensação física chegar, pode dizer-se que o sonhador passou além do 1º grau do sonho. Isto é, q[uando] um romance sobre combates, fugas, batalhas, nos deixa o corpo realmente moído, as pernas cansadas... o 1º grau está conseguido. No caso do sensual, deverá ele - sem receber a mensagem mais que mental[mente] - ter uma ejaculação q[uan]do um momento desses chegar no romance.\\n\\nDepois procurará traduzir tudo isso para mental. A ejaculação, no caso do sensual (que escolho para exemplo, porque é o mais violento e frisante) deverá ser \\n\\nsentida sem se ter dado. \\n\\nO cansaço será m[ui]to maior, mas o prazer é completamente mais intenso.\\n\\nNo 3º grau passa toda a sensação a ser mental. Custa o prazer e custa o cansaço, mas o corpo já nada sente, e em vez dos membros lassos, a inteligência, a vontade [?], ou a emoção é que ficam bambas-frouxas... Quando aqui é tempo de passar para o grau supremo do sonho.\\n\\nO supremo grau é o construir romances para si próprio. Só deve tentar-se isto q[uan]do se está perfeitamente mentalizado o sonho, como antes disse. Se não, o esforço inicial em criar os romances, perturbará a perfeita mentalização do gozo.\\n[…]\\nJá educada a imaginação, basta querer, e ela se encarregará de construir os sonhos para si.\\nJá aqui o cansaço é quase nulo, mental. Há uma dissolução absoluta da personalidade. Somos mera cinza, dotada de alma, sem forma - nem mesmo a da água que é a da vasilha que a contém.\\n- Bem aprontado isto (...), devemos poder aparecer em nós, verso ou romance, descobrindo-nos alheios e perfeitos. Talvez já não haja a força de os escrevermos - mas isso será preciso. Poderemos criar em 2ª mão - imaginar em nós um poeta a escrever, e ele escrevendo de uma maneira, outro poeta [...] escreverá de outra. Eu, em virtude de ter apurado imenso esta faculdade, procuro escrever de inúmeras maneiras diversas, originais todas.\\nO mais alto grau do sonho é q[uan]do criado um quadro com personagens, vivemos todas elas ao mesmo tempo - somos todas essas almas conjunta e interactívamente.\\nÉ visível o grau de despersonalização e de encinzamento[?] do espírito a que isto leva, e é difícil confesso, fugir a um cansaço geral de todo o ser ao fazê-lo...

       "  'text': '\\nSenhor António:\\nO senhor nunca há-de ver esta carta, nem eu a hei-de ver segunda vez porque estou tuberculosa, mas eu quero escrever-lhe ainda que o senhor o não saiba, porque se não escrevo abafo.\\nO senhor não sabe quem eu sou, isto é, sabe mas não sabe a valer. Tem-me visto à janela quando o senhor passa para a oficina e eu olho para si, porque o espero a chegar, e sei a hora que o senhor chega. Deve sempre ter pensado sem importância na corcunda do primeiro andar da casa amarela, mas eu não penso senão em si. Sei que o senhor tem uma amante, que é aquela rapariga loura alta e bonita; eu tenho inveja dela mas não tenho ciúmes de si porque não tenho direito a ter nada, nem mesmo ciúmes. Eu gosto de si porque gosto de si, e tenho pena de não ser outra mulher, com outro corpo e outro feitio, e poder ir à rua e falar consigo ainda que o senhor me não desse razão de nada, mas eu estimava conhecê-lo de falar.\\nO senhor é tudo quanto me tem valido na minha doença e eu estou-lhe agradecida sem que o senhor o saiba. Eu nunca poderia ter ninguém que gostasse de mim como se gosta das pessoas que têm o corpo de que se pode gostar, mas eu tenho o direito de gostar sem que gostem de mim, e também tenho o direito de chorar, que não se negue a ninguém.\\nEu gostava de morrer depois de lhe falar a primeira vez mas nunca terei coragem nem maneiras de lhe falar. Gostava que o senhor soubesse que eu gostava muito de si, mas tenho medo que se o senhor soubesse não se importasse nada, e eu tenho pena já de saber que isso é absolutamente certo antes de saber qualquer coisa, que eu mesmo não vou procurar saber.\\nEu sou corcunda desde a nascença e sempre riram de mim. Dizem que todas as corcundas são más, mas eu nunca quis mal a ninguém. Alem disso sou doente, e nunca tive alma, por causa da doença, para ter grandes raivas. Tenho dezanove anos e nunca sei para que é que cheguei a ter tanta idade, e doente, e sem ninguém que tivesse pena de mim a não ser por eu ser corcunda, que é o menos, porque é a alma que me dói, e não o corpo, pois a corcunda não faz dor.\\nEu até gostava de saber como é a sua vida com a sua amiga, porque como é uma vida que eu nunca posso ter - e agora menos que nem vida tenho - gostava de saber tudo.\\nDesculpe escrever-lhe tanto sem o conhecer, mas o senhor não vai ler isto, e mesmo que lesse nem sabia que era consigo e não ligava importância em qualquer caso, mas gostaria que pensasse que é triste ser marreca e viver sempre so à janela, e ter mãe e irmãs que gostam da gente mas sem ninguém que goste de nós, porque tudo isso é natural e é a família, e o que faltava é que nem isso houvesse para uma boneca com os ossos às avessas como eu sou, como eu já ouvi dizer.\\nHouve um dia que o senhor vinha para a oficina e um gato se pegou à pancada com um cão aqui defronte da janela, e todos estivemos a ver, e o senhor parou, ao pé do Manuel das Barbas, na esquina do barbeiro, e depois olhou para mim para a janela, e viu-me a rir e riu também para mim, e essa foi a única vez que o senhor esteve a sós comigo, por assim dizer, que isso nunca poderia eu esperar.\\nTantas vezes, o senhor não imagina, andei à espera que houvesse outra coisa qualquer na rua quando o senhor passasse e eu pudesse outra vez ver o senhor a ver e talvez olhasse para mim e eu pudesse olhar para si e ver os seus olhos a direito para os meus.\\nMas eu não consigo nada do que quero, nasci já assim, e até tenho que estar em cima de um estrado para poder estar à altura da janela. Passo todo o dia a ver iltustrações e revistas de modas que emprestam à minha mãe, e estou sempre a pensar noutra coisa, tanto que quando me perguntam como era aquela saia ou quem é que estava no retrato onde está a Rainha de Inglaterra, eu às vezes me envergonha de não saber, porque estive a ver coisas que não podem ser e que eu não posso deixar que me entrem na cabeça e me dêem alegria para eu depois ainda por cima ter vontade de chorar.\\nDepois todos me desculpam, e acham que sou tonta, mas não me julgam parva, porque ninguém julga isso, e eu chego a não ter pena da desculpa, porque assim não tenho que explicar porque é que estive distraída.\\nAinda me lembro daquele dia que o senhor passou aqui ao Domingo com o fato azul claro. Não era azul claro, mas era uma sarja muito clara para o azul escuro que costuma ser. O senhor ia que parecia o próprio dia que estava lindo e eu nunca tive tanta inveja de toda a gente como nesse dia. Mas não tive inveja da sua amiga, a não ser que o senhor não fosse ter com ela mas com outra qualquer, porque eu não pensei senão em si, e foi por isso que invejei toda a gente, o que não percebo mas o certo é que é verdade.\\nNão é por ser corcunda que estou aqui sempre à janela, mas é que ainda por cima tenho uma espécie de reumatismo nas pernas e não me posso mexer, e assim estou como se fosse paralítica, o que é uma maçada para todos cá em casa e eu sinto ter que ser toda a gente a aturar-me e a ter que me aceitar que o senhor não imagina. Eu às vezes dá-me um desespero como se me pudesse atirar da janela abaixo, mas eu que figura teria a cair da janela? Até quem me visse cair ria e a janela é tão baixa que eu nem morreria, mas era ainda mais maçada para os outros, e estou a ver-me na rua como uma macaca, com as pernas à vela e a corcunda a sair pela blusa e toda a gente a querer ter pena mas a ter nojo ao mesmo tempo ou a rir se calhasse, porque a gente é como é não como tinha vontade de ser.\\n(…)\\n- e enfim porque lhe estou eu a escrever se lhe não vou mandar esta carta? \\nO senhor que anda de um lado para o outro não sabe qual é o peso de a gente não ser ninguém. Eu estou à janela todo o dia e vejo toda a gente passar de um lado para o outro e ter um modo de vida e gozar e falar a esta e àquela, e parece que sou um vaso com uma planta murcha que ficou aqui à janela por tirar de lá.\\nO senhor não pode imaginar, porque é bonito e tem saúde o que é a gente ter nascido e não ser gente, e ver nos jornais o que as pessoas fazem, e uns são ministros e andam de um lado para o outro a visitar todas as terras, e outros estão na vida da sociedade e casam e têm baptizados e estão doentes e fazem-lhe operações os mesmos médicos, e outros partem para as suas casas aqui e ali, e outros roubam e outros queixam-se, e uns fazem grandes crimes e há artigos assinados por outros e retratos e anúncios com os nomes dos homens que vão comprar as modas ao estrangeiro, e tudo isto o senhor não imagina o que é para quem é um trapo como eu que ficou no parapeito da janela de limpar o sinal redondo dos vasos quando a pintura é fresca por causa da água.\\nSe o senhor soubesse isto tudo era capaz de de vez em quando me dizer adeus da rua, e eu gostava de se lhe poder pedir isso, porque o senhor não imagina, eu talvez não vivesse mais, que pouco é o que tenho de viver, mas eu ia mais feliz lá para onde se vai se soubesse que o senhor me dava os bons dias por acaso.\\nA Margarida costureira diz que lhe falou uma vez, que lhe falou torto porque o senhor se meteu com ela na rua aqui ao lado, e essa vez é que eu senti inveja a valer, eu confesso porque não lhe quero mentir, senti inveja porque meter-se alguém connosco é a gente ser mulher, e eu não sou mulher nem homem, porque ninguém acha que eu sou nada a não ser uma espécie de gente que está para aqui a encher o vão da janela e a aborrecer tudo que me vê, valha-me Deus.\\nO António (é o mesmo nome que o seu, mas que diferença!) o António da oficina de automóveis disse uma vez a meu pai que toda a gente deve produzir qualquer coisa, que sem isso não há direito a viver, que quem não trabalha não come e não há direito a haver quem não trabalhe. E eu pensei que faço eu no mundo, que não faço nada senão estar à janela com toda a gente a mexer-se de um lado para o outro, sem ser paralítica, e tendo maneira de encontrar as pessoas de quem gosta, e depois poderia produzir à vontade o que fosse preciso porque tinha gosto para isso.\\nAdeus senhor Antonio, eu não tenho senão dias de vida e escrevo esta carta só para a guardar no peito como se fosse uma carta que o senhor me escrevesse em vez de eu a escrever a si. Eu desejo que o senhor tenha todas as felicidades que possa desejar e que nunca saiba de mim para não rir porque eu sei que não posso esperar mais.\\nEu amo o senhor com toda a minha alma e toda a minha vida.\\nAí tem e estou a chorar.\\n\\nMaria José\\n',\n",

Machado, no discurso do Porto, mostra-se tão ignorante de como se é subtil, tão brutamontes no cá-estou-eu, tão labrego no insinuar, tão indecentemente saracoteador da sua candidatura, que qualquer meio-juízo compreenderia o que de anti-diplomático, não-frio e nada-esperto aquele espírito é. E esta consideração sobressalta porque nos põe na alma uma interrogação do que seria nas [...] do ministério dos negócios estrangeiros a acção de tão desmandada besta. O discurso do Porto faz na [...] da verdade a frase retratadora de Homem Cristo: pano-[...] era o que ele chamara a Bernardino. Chamara-lhe também [...]; mas há melhor no [...] género -\"Bernardino Manchado\" sabe [?] menos da exactidão alfabética — porém mais vincadamente perto da precisão descritiva.\\n',\n",

Isso mostra o seu interesse pela nossa revista, mas era realmente desnecessário que v. se tivesse incomodado assim. Chegando os seus poemas na mala de aqui a dias chegam bem a tempo. Oxalá v. tenha mandado bastantes coisas, para podermos ver bem quais devem representar melhor para o público a feição do seu Espírito.\\nA composição da nossa revista será a seguinte:\\n\\n\\n              1. Introdução — Luís de Montalvor.            \\n\\n              2. Para os «Indícios de Oiro» — poemas de Mário de Sá-Carneiro.            \\n\\n              3. Poemas — de Ronald de Carvalho.            \\n\\n              4. O Marinheiro — drama estático em um quadro, de Fernando Pessoa.            \\n\\n              5. Treze Sonetos — de Alfredo Pedro Guisado.            \\n\\n              6. Frisos — contos do desenhador, José de Almada Negreiros.            \\n7. Poemas (ou outro título qualquer) de Côrtes-Rodrigues.\\n\\n              8. Narciso — poema de Luís de Montalvor.            \\n\\n\\n              Tudo isto deve dar para cima de 80 páginas. A revista — não sei se já lhe disse — é trimestral. O primeiro número deve sair no fim de Março corrente; os outros, correspondentemente, em fins de Junho, Setembro, Dezembro. O preço de cada número é de 300 réis. A assinatura para continente e ilhas é 1000 réis por ano, pelos 4 números.            \\nVamos a ver se conseguimos aguentar a revista até, pelo menos, ao 4.º número, para que ao menos um volume fique formado. Vai ficar uma coisa muito boa, com um ar definitivo, de coisa que fica. Bem orientada, deve pegar a valer. Parece-me isto, sobretudo por causa da venda e das assinaturas no Brasil, que o Luís de Montalvor (director em Portugal), que esteve bastante tempo no Brasil, e o Ronald de Carvalho, director do Brasil, devem conseguir obter.\\n\\n              Ora, a propósito de assinaturas, ocorre-me que, quando nós aqui falámos em sair, não sei se era com a Lusitânia, se era com a Europa, v. me citou nomes de várias pessoas cuja assinatura para a revista v. disse poder obter. V. recorda-se sem dúvida que tratámos deste assunto nos «Irmãos Unidos» e que eu assentava num livrinho os nomes dos assinantes prováveis, pondo adiante, entre parênteses, as iniciais de aquele de nós que as poderia obter. Tenho aqui esse livrinho e transcrevo os nomes seguintes, de assinaturas prováveis, aos quais estão apensas as iniciais de v. É para v. ver se pode conseguir, então, estas assinaturas, e outras de que se recorde. Escreva-me sobre este assunto, dizendo-me tudo o que for preciso para nós aqui tratarmos dessas assinaturas; a saber — (1) se devemos enviar as revistas para v., ou para eles, ou para outra parte qualquer; (2) se as revistas deverão ser dirigidas a cada um dos que v. indicar acompanhadas de uma carta da gerência da revista pedindo a assinatura — tendo v., é claro, previamente falado com esses indivíduos a respeito disso. Indique-me tudo como puder, na primeira mala, visto que essa sua carta deve chegar aqui antes (com certeza) de a revista estar impressa. Temos que tratar afincadamente — como v. compreende — da parte-administração da revista; que é por descurar esta parte que costumam cair, em geral, as revistas literárias. Indique-me v. também para onde, em Ponta Delgada (e outros pontos de 5. Miguel, se valer a pena) se devem mandar exemplares para a venda avulso; quantos exemplares; se v. fala aos donos desses estabelecimentos, etc., etc. Temos que firmar esta revista, porque ela é a ponte por onde a nossa Alma passa para o futuro.            \\n\\n              Aí vão os nomes que v. citou como sendo os dos assinantes que v. poderia arranjar: Agostinho Pizarro — Dr. António César Rodrigues — P.e Manuel Ernesto Ferreira — Teobaldo da Câmara — Dr. Albano de Gusmão Tavares — José Leão — Teotónio da Silveira Moniz — Dr. António Saraiva — Dr. Mont'Alverne de Sequeira — Honorato Bernardo Bettencourt — Augusto Loureiro — Cândido Garcia Reis — Alberto Martins — Dr. Nuno de Gusmão — Dr. Eduardo de Luís Tavares — Marquês de Jácome Corréa — Coronel Francisco Afonso Chaves — Narciso de Morais — Conde de Botelho. Não sei se eles são todos de aí. V. verá e dirá. Claro está que não incluí na lista os nomes do Norberto Corrêa e do Rocha, porque a esses falo eu aqui. Na lista vai o nome Cândido Garcia Reis. É aquele rapaz a quem v. me apresentou, não é verdade? aquele que estava doente. Incluí o nome dele na lista porque, apesar de ele estar cá (vi-o há dias), não o conheço suficientemente para lhe poder falar sobre o assunto.            \\n\\n              Ia-me esquecendo ... com efeito, esqueci-me... Na lista da colaboração da revista, depois dos Frisos do Almada Negreiros vão duas poesias do meu filho Álvaro de Campos — o homem da ode de cuja terminação (descritiva da Noite) você tanto gostava. Uma das poesias é aquela Ode Triunfal (o canto das máquinas e da civilização moderna) que v. já conhece. A outra é uma poesia anterior (que é posterior) do mesmo cavalheiro. Depois, quando seguir para aí a revista, lhe falarei deste assunto mais detalhadamente. Escuso de lhe falar do segredo «absoluto» disto tudo, não é verdade?            \\nEstou ainda sem saber se v. recebeu aquela minha carta em que eu lhe mandava versos. Oxalá não se perdesse. Teria muita pena se assim tivesse acontecido.\\n\\n              O meu drama estático «O Marinheiro» está bastante alterado e aperfeiçoado; a forma que v. conhece é apenas a primeira e rudimentar. O final, especialmente, está muito melhor. Não ficou, talvez, uma coisa grande, como eu entendo as coisas grandes; mas não é coisa de que eu me envergonhe, nem — creio — me venha a envergonhar.            \\n\\nDê os meus melhores cumprimentos a seu Pai e receba, meu querido Côrtes-Rodrigues, um grande abraço do seu muito amigo, admirador e obrigado.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Fernando Pessoa\\n\\n\\n              P.

Those are errors of the path where the path itself is taken for its purpose. Those are errors of the Inn where halfway is taken for all the way. Those are errors of the Cave where the cave, which is at the base of the Castle, is taken for the Castle itself (is taken for the Hall of the Castle).\\n\\nThese errors are common to all paths, and that of Gnosis is no more free from them than the mystical and the magical paths.\\n\\nI can dispense with asceticism, but not with truth, nor will I believe that God will not be manifest to me unless I can sit still for five hours or can breathe naturally through either nostril at will.\\n\\nThe fact is, however, that whatever the path that is taken, it should not be taken before the preparatory grades, the neophyte grades, have been traversed. Mysticism seeks to transcend the intellect (by intuition), magic to transcend the intellect by power; gnosis to transcend the intellect by a higher intellect. But to transcend a thing rightly you must first pass through that thing. The advantage of the gnostic path is that there is less temptation to reach the higher intellect without passing through the lower, since both are intellect and there is a difference of quantity between the one and the other, than in the mystic and the magic paths, where there is a difference of quality, not quantity, between emotion and intellect; between the will and intellect.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nOc.\\n\\nThere are three distinct types of initiation — symbolic or outer, intellectual (outer of inner), and vital (inner). In the symbolic initiations, which reinforce the will and therefore lead to Magic as attainment, the candidate does not pass through stages of understanding, but through stages of intuition, so to speak; he is continually on the surface and appearance of things, and, though he attains the highest degree in whatever order or orders he goes through, that highest degree need not correspond (generally does not correspond) to anything like a parallel degree in any of the inner initiations. In the intellectual initiations, which reinforce the intellect and therefore lead to Mysticism as attainment, the candidate passes through stages of understanding, but not through stages of life; he may know much, but he need not live that which he knows on the same level as he knows it. In the vital initiations, which reinforce the emotion and therefore lead to Alchemy as an attainment, the candidate lives that which he feels and knows.\\n\\n(Is this right? Do not rather these initiations differ on another score, whereas the difference between Magic, Mysticism and Alchemy (what of Gnosis?) lies on another plane of interpretation? Are not these initiations rather physical, etheric and astral? (or, perhaps, etheric, astral and spiritual, or astral, mental and spiritual?)\\n\\n\\xa0— Possibly there are three modes in which initiations can be interpreted: (l) the three ways of attainment, magical, mystical and gnostic, (2) the three stages of attainment, Neophyte, Adept and Master, (3) the three degrees of attainment, astral, mental and spiritual.\\n',\n",

É em mim...

Dói ver no parque o abandono\\nDa fonte sem repuxo... Ninguém ergue o olhar da estrada\\nE sente saudades de si ante aquele lugar-Outono...\\nEsta paisagem é um manuscrito com a frase mais bela cortada...\\n\\nA doida partiu todos os candelabros glabros,\\nSujou de humano o lago com cartas rasgadas, muitas...\\nE a minha alma é aquela luz que não mais haverá nos candelabros...\\nE que querem ao lado aziago minhas ânsias, brisas fortuitas?...\\n\\nPorque me aflijo e me enfermo?... Deitam-se nuas ao luar\\nTodas as ninfas... Veio o sol e já tinham partido...\\nO teu silêncio que me embala é a ideia de naufragar,\\nE a ideia de a tua voz soar a lira dum Apolo fingido...\\n\\nJá não há caudas de pavões todas olhos nos jardins de outrora...\\nAs próprias sombras estão mais tristes... Ainda\\nHá rastos de vestes de aias (parece) no chão, e ainda chora\\nUm como que eco de passos pela alameda que eis finda...\\n\\nTodos os ocasos fundiram-se na minha alma...\\nAs relvas de todos os prados foram frescas sob meus pés frios...\\nSecou em teu olhar a ideia de te julgares calma,\\nE eu ver isso em ti é um porto sem navios...\\n\\nErgueram-se a um tempo todos os remos... Pelo ouro das searas\\nPassou uma saudade de não serem o mar.. Em frente\\nAo meu trono de alheamento há gestos com pedras raras...\\nMinha alma é uma lâmpada que se apagou e ainda está quente...\\n\\nAh, e o teu silêncio é um perfil de píncaro ao sol!\\nTodas as princesas sentiram o seio oprimido...\\nDa última janela do castelo só um girassol\\nSe vê, e o sonhar que há outros põe brumas no nosso sentido...\\n\\nSermos, e não sermos mais!... Ó leões nascidos na jaula!...\\nRepique de sinos para além, no Outro Vale... Perto?...\\nArde o colégio e uma criança ficou fechada na aula...\\nPorque não há-de ser o Norte o Sul?... O que está descoberto?...\\n\\nE eu deliro... De repente pauso no que penso... Fito-te\\nE o teu silêncio é uma cegueira minha...

       "  'text': '\\nAlemanha e a Guerra\\n\\nMas neste momento, chegados nós a esta solução, visto como nasceu e como se formou, e que sentido civilizacional tem o Império Germânico, reparamos de súbito que a psique desse império, tal qual chegámos a vê-la ser, tem um feitio especial.\\nReparemos no seguinte: Os princípios emanados da Rev. Francesa estão na linha directa da evolução da civilização moderna. São eles, e não os princípios reactivos do império germânico, que estão na linha de evolução das sociedades modernas. Desde a Renascença que progressivamente se tem vindo caminhando para um individualismo mais acentuado, para uma cada vez mais complexa e turbulenta vida nacional.\\nQual é o facto capital da nossa civilização? Sabido que o facto mais importante de qualquer civilização é o conceito que nela se faz do conjunto das coisas e das suas relações veremos facilmente que no fenómeno religioso é que reside, fundamentalmente, o critério indicador da base civilizacional. Ora a nossa civilização é cristã. Assenta sobre os princípios religiosos chamados, no seu conjunto, cristianismo. Quais são esses princípios? Será possível determinar a evolução das sociedades modernas pela evolução desses princípios? É fácil.\\nO cristianismo é, acima de tudo, uma teoria igualitária. É, em seguida, uma teoria individualista; para o cristão cada alma humana tem uma importância excepcional, com as suas divinas qualidades de livre-arbítrio, de aspiração potencial ao Divino, de capacidade de imortalidade. Em terceiro lugar, logicamente, o cristianismo é uma teoria de fraternidade e de paz. De modo que o cristianismo assenta sobre três princípios: liberdade, igualdade e fraternidade. A Revolução Francesa foi puro cristianismo.\\nOcorrerá a um leitor menos subtil perguntar por que é que se o cristianismo é liberdade, igualdade e fraternidade, ele tem aplicado tão pouco esses princípios pela civilização fora. Em primeiro lugar, porque esses princípios são antagónicos à existência social, e aplicá-los, realmente e a valer, seria destruir a sociedade. Em segundo lugar, porque as sociedades cristãs têm em geral sido sociedades atrasadas, como as medievais, onde, além do forte império das instituições sociais rudimentares, como a força, a autoridade, pouco campo psíquico há, dado que são sãs e rudes, para a aplicação dos princípios de ternura e paz que o cristianismo trouxe. —  E pergunte o leitor a si próprio de que modo têm aplicado a  liberdade, a igualdade e a fraternidade as próprias sociedades emanadas da Revolução Francesa. Reporte-se ao caso\\n—  que está em primeira plana, porque ali foi feita essa Revolução — da França. Até que ponto tem este país aplicado na sua vida política esses ternos e comoventes princípios cristãos?\\nQual o processo sociológico pelo qual irrompeu — sob aspectos aliás longe de cristãos — o movimento cristão chamado a Revolução Francesa? Temos, para o ver claramente, que esboçar a evolução do cristianismo moderno.\\nDesde que se separou, na Renascença e depois da Reforma, do cristianismo católico, o  espírito cristão tem caminhado lentamente num determinado sentido. Esse sentido é o de afastar cada vez mais o dogma, a “letra”, como diz o Evangelho, e de se dedicar cada vez mais ao “espírito”. O protestantismo mais não é do que a subordinação do dogma à doutrina, a substituição gradual da autoridade pela consciência no cristianismo.\\nO cristianismo envolve três elementos: o dogma, a fé propriamente dita e a atitude emocional resumida nessa fé. Ora o protestantismo substituiu ao dogma a fé. Qual seria a evolução seguinte do cristianismo? A substituição do espírito cristão, puro e simples, à própria fé que o representa. Vimos já que esse espírito cristão é, na sua essência, Liberdade, Igualdade e Fraternidade. Daí a Revolução Francesa estar na linha de evolução religiosa do cristianismo. Esse movimento segue-se logicamente ao protestantismo. A Revolução Francesa é a Nova Reforma.\\nAs ideias democráticas são cristianismo puro. Como tal pertencem ao espírito cristão. Como tais, são inimigas do catolicismo, que é o dogma, a parte mais dura e rígida do cristianismo; como o protestantismo, erguendo-se pela fé, foi contra o espírito católico.\\nA Europa é cada vez mais cristã. Cada vez mais abandona a letra do Cristianismo e se aplica ao seu espírito. Todo o fanatismo, toda a intolerância, toda a confusão mental, a sentimentalidade doentia dos democratas, mostram bem a base doentiamente religiosa do seu sistema.\\nOra a nossa civilização, se bem que cristã de natureza, repousa sobre uma outra base, que não o cristianismo. Todo o nosso trabalho mental, toda a nossa disciplina de espírito, toda alma da nossa jurisprudência, o âmago do nosso modo de governar assentam numa base — o espírito pagão — a cultura grega e a administração romana. Nascido, como foi, na decadência do império romano, o cristianismo é um paganismo decadente. Quanto mais cristão se torna, quanto mais se afasta do paganismo —  isto é do catolicismo, que é abundantemente pagão, sobretudo pelo ritual — tanto mais o cristianismo se afirma decadente e doentio.\\nTemos, pois, uma dupla evolução dentro da nossa civilização. Temos a evolução dela no que propriamente cristã. E temos a sua evolução no que pagã. Na linha de evolução cristã, vimos que estão a Reforma e a Revolução Francesa. A Revolução Francesa resultou da penetração da França pelo espírito protestante, quer através do suíço Rosseau, quer através da furiosa anglofilia do século XVIII em França.\\nMas na evolução das sociedades modernas outra linha se segue, paralelamente; temos o movimento da Renascença, que é diferente. Ele ajudou a formar-se a reforma, mas, em si, tem características inteiramente diferentes. É pagão, puramente pagão. Assim, quando ele aparece, vemos aparecer os característicos típicos da mentalidade pagã: o despotismo pessoal, (...)\\nPara onde seguiu este movimento que a Renascença gerou? Qual é o movimento que o prolonga, e houve deveras movimento que o prolongasse?\\nComo nasceu a Renascença? Não nasceu, repare-se, duma evolução do cristianismo; nasceu, ao contrário, duma aplicação de parte do espírito cristão a pontos anticristãos. Aquela parte do cristianismo representada pelo dogma, com a sua dureza e a sua autoridade, foi utilizada pela Renascença, mas o espírito cristão abandonado por completo. De maneira que a Renascença é um movimento de característicos inteiramente opostos aos da Reforma (não esqueço que veio antes). Segue um sentido contrário. Adopta do cristianismo a atitude imperialista e dogmática; mas despreza-lhe os correctivos a essa atitude que vem do espírito cristão, sempre presente onde haja cristianismo.\\nPara a paganização total, seria preciso despir do imperialismo o espírito pagão. Caído o império germânico, esse fim será talvez conseguido. O imperialismo de domínio é da decadência do paganismo, de Atenas e Roma decadentes. Precisamos criar um imperialismo de influência, como o de Atenas original.\\n\\n1. Formação do Estado Alemão e do Actual Império.\\n2. O Estado Alemão como Força Civilizadora.\\n3.

       "  'text': '\\nAlemanha e a Guerra\\n\\nO grande problema do Estado futuro consiste na organização com a mínima compressão possível da liberdade. No estado em que as almas estão hoje, não é possível organizar sem oprimir e não é possível portanto um Estado alemão sem uma tirania alemã. Tem-se exagerado, de resto, o aspecto dessa tirania. Os que a “sofrem” parecem não a sentir muito.\\nDado que os princípios emanados da Revolução Francesa tendiam a agravar enormemente as naturais tendências de qualquer sociedade a desintegrar-se, e as maiores tendências para a desintegração das sociedades modernas, vítimas da incursão rápida de um grande número de factores (estranhos a essa Revolução alguns, outros presos a ela, outros estranhos, mas misturando-se-lhe), o Estado alemão, se havia de organizar, de disciplinar, de civilizar, tinha, fatalmente, que começar por se opor a essas tendências, por tentar esmagá-las. Tal qual como, entre nós, há pouco, o general Pimenta de Castro, querendo implantar entre nós a liberdade, teve fatalmente que empregar certa violência para com o partido democrático, por ser esse o inimigo da liberdade, e por sinal caiu por não oprimir bastante essa horrenda (...)\\nO Estado alemão, por isso, tinha forçosamente que ser um estado “reaccionário”. De resto, os outros aspectos da sua vida a isso o obrigavam. O seu carácter de estado hegemónico e guerreiro (a Prússia, Kriegsstaat,  como diz Treitschke), as suas tradições imperialistas, a tendência universalista da sua cultura (goethiana ou outra) que, para ser cosmopolita sem ser antinacional, risco que corria, dado o carácter disperso dos estados alemães — tinha de dar à sua própria universalidade um carácter de dureza, de se apoiar à tendência militarista do estado-regente: tudo isto criou o estado alemão, tal qual nós o conhecemos, e tudo isto é, como estamos vendo, fortemente e conscientemente, e habilmente  civilizacional. Em contraste com a vida anárquica e dispersa das sociedades extragermânicas, o Estado alemão tomou consciência cívilizacionaI de si próprio; e isso nenhum outro estado europeu ainda fez. É vasto o império inglês, mas a Inglaterra não criou um imperialismo; expandiu-se, mas não civilizacionou o espírito de expansão. O seu império é uma obra de acaso, de indivíduos, de muitos indivíduos, de muitos indivíduos pessoalmente activos e trabalhadores, cada qual tratando de si, ou unindo-se em grupos sem outro fim que um fim estreitamente administrativo, como se viu no sentido estreito e material da estreita obra do seu sumo homem, Cecil Rhodes. Ora, nenhuma nação tem o direito de usar do império (to wield empire) se não é capaz de organizar o império.\\nEmprego as razões mais evidentes, e deixo de lado as superiores, as mais importantes. Essas jazem ocultas na teoria do imperialismo, que é quase hora de fazer — não imperialismo entendido como domínio pela força (quem o iria teorizar para o nosso pequeno povo?), mas o imperialismo como influenciação civilizacional, que um povo, pequeno ou grande, pode realizar, e de esta ou aquela maneira, consoante é grande ou pequeno.\\nA coisa que mais urgentemente se impõe hoje em Portugal é a construção de um imperialismo português. Qual deve ser esse imperialismo, de que espécie, agindo de que maneira? Tudo isso sairá da consideração atenta do problema, e do sentido especial que a palavra “imperialismo” terá de tomar neste caso. Para isso, a meu ver, nada pode ter tão férteis resultados como uma aliança espiritual com a Alemanha, que, por ser nossa análoga psíquica, nos deve legar a continuação espiritual daquele imperialismo, daquela atitude anticristã, que ela, por seu grande poder material, não pode doravante tentar realizar senão pela força, e não pelo espírito.\\nToda a obra antigermânica, hoje, em Portugal, emana de traidores à pátria porque emana de criaturas desintegradas da nossa alma nacional. Os que querem um Portugal honesto, feliz, rico e honrado, querem a negação da acção civilizacional portuguesa, querem que desçamos ao burguesismo nacional duma pseudonação como a Suíça ou a Bélgica, querem que abandonemos o nosso grande papel na construção do novo mundo, que abdiquemos de realizar em espírito aquilo que realizámos outrora em corpo — o alargamento do mundo e a descoberta de novas terras, de novos mares, de novos céus. Mais alta é a missão portuguesa do que tudo quanto pode sugerir a barriga dos portugueses, nessa pervertida teoria política que toda a chusma de traidores e de idiotas que são os nossos políticos e os nossos jornalistas querem impor a Portugal. Mais alta é a obra, e ela, a ser feita, terá de ser feita quebrando aos pés toda a longa podridão humanitária, democrática, organizando uma aristocracia forte, dominando completamente a nossa plebe ineficaz salvo escravizada.\\nRealizemos em nossa alma a vinda de D. Sebastião. Realize-mo-la como ela deve ser realizada, seguindo as pisadas da Alemanha, e levando a obra mais além — obra pagã, obra anti-humanitária, obra de transcendência e de elevação, feita através daquela crueldade para com nós próprios que o espírito de Nietzsche, num momento lúcido, viu ser a base de todo o sentimento do império.\\nCriar em Portugal o sentimento duma missão civilizadora! Esse deve ser o nosso ideal. O resto não importa. Que para chegar aí seja preciso varrer à metralha as ruas, calcar aos pés a felicidade e a liberdade do povo, arremessá-lo como um aríete de encontro às barreiras do nosso espírito — que importa isso, se só assim podemos deixar ficar Portugal no mundo depois de ele desaparecer?\\nGrande e difícil é a obra! Grande e difícil o varrer dos  ideais democráticos, humanitários e utilitários. Mas a grande anti-cristã (anti-cristã em tudo, antidemocrática, anticatólica antimonárquica) deve ser feita. Tristes de nós se faltarmos à missão divina que Aquele que nos pôs ao Ocidente da Europa, e tais nos fez quais somos, nos impôs quando nos deu este nosso acesso e transcendido espírito aventureiro. Depois da conquista dos mares deve vir a conquista das almas. O resto — a felicidade nacional, a boa administração, a liberdade, a lealdade, a honra — não são senão o lixo que atulha o caminho dos nosso gestos.\\n\\nSursum corda!\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nEm «O Mundo», de 10 deste Julho, publicou o Sr. João de Barros, a propósito da Guerra, um apelo aos escritores portugueses. O apelo era para que, embora Portugal tivesse (por razões diplomáticas) de não intervir na guerra, eles, representantes pela inteligência da raça portuguesa, declarassem bem alto que estão ao lado dos aliados na presente contenda. O Sr. João de Barros justificava este apelo, não só pela necessidade de se sair do silêncio em que, até agora, têm jazido os intelectuais pátrios  mas\\ntambém mediante o, conhecido e previsível, argumento de que Portugal se deve declarar nitidamente compartilhador espiritual das aspirações e da causa dos aliados, vistos o seu carácter de povo “latino”, o facto de que os aliados lutam «pela liberdade e pela justiça», pela civilização “latina” e por outras coisas já nossas conhecidas em estas conjunturas dialécticas.\\nEu concordo com a necessidade, que o Sr. João de Barros oportunamente apontou, de que os intelectuais portugueses saiam do seu silêncio. Concordo com que, sendo eles — por sua natureza de intelectuais — os orientadores-natos da gente da sua raça, devam, na conjuntura civilizacional presente, dizer qualquer coisa, assentar quaisquer princípios. Levo mais longe do que uma mera concordância o meu assentimento à observação do Sr. João de Barros. Acho que é chegada a hora de se dizer alto e claro ao povo português qual é a verdade portuguesa sobre a guerra, isto é, qual seja a atitude genuinamente e relevantemente nacional que deve surgir perante o aspecto que toma o actual conflito.\\nTanto mais concordo com a urgência desta necessidade quanto me parece que nela está envolvida a mais larga urgência, que há, de aclarar um pouco ao povo português qual deva ser, em boa lógica nacional, o sentido do seu destino. E reforça-se em mim o desejo de trazer qualquer contribuição a este assunto, quanto mais pondero que até agora este povo não tem sido senão vítima de ludíbrio baixo e reles de políticos sem carácter, de dirigentes em inteligência e de jornalistas sem patriotismo nem cultura — o que importa muito para um povo que, mesmo nas suas camadas ditas “superiores”, pouco vai além do jornal no seu trato inteligente com as coisas hodiernas.\\nProponho-me demonstrar —  em contrário do sentido do apelo do Sr. João de Barros — que a alma portuguesa deve estar com a sua irmã, a alma germânica, na guerra presente. Antes de mais nada, indicarei quais os pontos que não trato neste breve opúsculo, quer porque sejam de algum modo estranhos ao seu âmbito, quer porque sejam de uma ou outra maneira desnecessários ao seu fim.\\nComo o Sr. João de Barros no seu artigo, não me preocupará o problema da nossa participação na guerra. Duas razões me conduzem a esta abstinência. A primeira é que, país pequeno, fraco e desgovernado (por dois regimes de impostores e de ladrões), país colocado fora do teatro directo da guerra, a nossa acção militar ou outra nada traria por si de útil à solução, guerreira ou outra, do problema. Nada pesamos na balança das forças eficientes e por isso qualquer consideração sobre a nossa\\ndevida atitude espiritual não pode envolver uma necessidade de que essa atitude passe de espiritual a activa. — A segunda razão é que — posto pois o problema da nossa intervenção na guerra apenas como problema de conveniência nacional — era preciso para determinar tal conveniência, ou negá-la, que eu conhecesse qual é, deveras, a nossa situação internacional, e eu não a conheço. — Resta a terceira razão; e essa, embora em si de pouco peso, é a de mais directo relevo para o assunto que trato. É que, como desde logo o notou o Sr. João de Barros, sujeito também porventura à consideração das duas razões que apontei, não se trata de determinar qual deva ser o papel do estado português na actual conjuntura, mas sim qual o dos espíritos portugueses perante ela. Resumirei portanto o meu esforço — conforme nisto com a justa exigência limitativa do Sr. João de Barros — a demonstrar que espiritualmente, e pelas várias razões que exporei, a alma portuguesa deve estar com a alma alemã.\\nEu disse que havia duas ordens de coisas, relacionadas com este assunto, que não trataria. As primeiras são aquelas que seria desnecessário tratar. A estas me referi no parágrafo concluso. Resta dizer qual é a outra ordem de coisas — aquelas de que disse que eram propriamente, não desnecessárias, mas estranhas, ao assunto tal como tenho de o versar.\\nSão duas coisas apenas. A primeira é a hipótese sobre qual deva ser o resultado da guerra, quer material, quer espiritual, civilizacional. Compreende-se bem que importa pouco, para o estudo presente, qual seja o resultado material e imediato da guerra. Esse resultado depende da acção das grandes forças em choque presentemente, e o nosso reduzido núcleo nacional nada tira nem põe, nada pode tirar ou pôr, para o caso. Esse resultado, de outro lado, afectar-nos-á consoante o estado verdadeiro da nossa situação internacional, e essa, como disse, nem sei qual seja, nem vem para o caso presente, pois que a atitude intelectual, que tomarmos, pouca ou nenhuma importância pode ter para o que depende apenas da desconhecida situação em que o nosso país se encontra internacionalmente colocado. Esse resultado, por último, justamente por se tratar do resultado material da guerra, cai fora da órbita das nossas considerações, que, versando qual deva ser a nossa atitude espiritual perante esta guerra, ex hipothesi se não preocupam com os resultados materiais da guerra, senão nos seus prováveis reflexos espirituais, o que nos coloca já na consideração dos resultados espirituais da guerra.\\nA consideração dos resultados espirituais da guerra toma dois aspectos, conforme nos refiramos aos resultados directamente espirituais por reflexo dos materiais (...)\\n',\n",

Já vimos que esse papel envolveu, em ambos os casos, uma idêntica inversão do carácter nacional, em ambos os casos um conceito metódico e organizado da obra civilizacional. Outras, flagrantes, semelhanças existem.\\nPara o Portugal presente, oprimido e esbatido, como para a Alemanha humilhada do princípio do século passado, o que existe que os levante é uma tradição de império, e, em ambos os casos, uma tradição inteiramente quebrada e envilecida. Em ambos os casos se dá um fenómeno curioso, evocador dessa tradição através dum curioso sentimento de misticismo nacional. No caso da Alemanha é a lenda de Frederico Barbarossa, morto em viagem para o Oriente, e que espera o dia em que, voltando, há-de restituir à sua Pátria o império e a grandeza. (Q. Rückert.) Assim, entre nós, da nossa grandeza ida, do nosso império morto, ficou a lenda mística e nacional de D. Sebastião, o qual também, para além de nós, espera a hora em que regresse para nos restituir a nossa grandeza. Ambas as lendas — bem sei — integram-se, segundo o delírio analógico de certos estudiosos magros destes assuntos, na lenda antiquíssima do Rei Artur. Mas isso é a aparência ilusória. O facto essencial é que, no caso da Alemanha, como no de Portugal, há bases concretas nacionais para que a lenda surgisse. Barbarossa e D. Sebastião — a semelhança mística e nacional das duas figuras é de ordem a fazer pensar, sobretudo quando ela se sobrepõe ás outras semelhanças essenciais, que já vimos, entre os caracteres básicos das duas nações.\\nA mais nítida obra civilizacional alemã do passado foi a Reforma. Se virmos em que condições nacionais essa obra se deu, não será difícil ver que elas se aproximam, flagrantemente, daquelas em que se deram as descobertas, salvo a superior orientação metódica e científica destas, análogas já não à obra alemã na Reforma, mas ao desenvolvimento organizado do actual Império Germânico. Mas aí há um factor que tudo explica — a nítida individualidade do nosso país, individualidade nítida que não existia nos dispersos estados da Alemanha quando Lutero surgiu. —  Aquela semelhança, porém, a que íamos aludir é a da confusão civilizacional em que as duas obras se realizaram. Portugal, se bem que nacionalidade nítida, era nacionalidade emergente; tanto assim que foi fácil, logo que entrou em decadência, ligá-lo a\\nEspanha. Semelhantemente, na Alemanha da Reforma, a acção alemã é nítida, mas a coesão nacional confusa. Mas, nos dois casos, a obra civilizacional realizada ficou como tradição espiritual, como base para a construção da nacionalidade futura .\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nHá só um problema de pós-guerra: é o problema da organização. Conforme esse problema se resolver, se resolverão os outros, todos dependentes dele. Porque de nada serve querer organizar ou a indústria, ou o trabalho, ou outra coisa qualquer que seja, sem primeiro organizar a organização, sem primeiro organizar os organizadores. Dar à palavra “organização”, ou a esse bordão absurdo dos idiotas da Inglaterra, “reconstrução”, um valor mágico ou miraculoso, de sorte que a mera invocação da ideia de organizar misteriosamente dê vista aos cegos, ouvido aos surdos e vida aos mortos — é de mais para uma época que, embora tenha uma mentalidade profundamente retrógrada, se tem por científica. Quem há-de organizar? Como organizar sem organizadores? Não basta a ideia da organização a seguir: temos que ter também homens que organizem. Muitas ideias são, quando não realmente boas, pelo menos aceitáveis; e assim pareceriam, se à testa da sua realização se não colocassem as incompetências do costume. É difícil fazer, mesmo, a crítica de certas ideias, porque, sem querer, fazemos a crítica dos homens que se interpretam. O próprio bolchevismo poderá na verdade ser interpretado pela figuras desmanchadas e reles de Lenine ou de Trotsky —  esses infelizes que, em uma época científica, governam a romântica, à (...)\\nComo, porém, organizar organizadores? O temperamento do organizador nasce, nos seus fundamentos, com o indivíduo; esse ponto está fora da competência de alguém. Mas é possível educar organizadores, para que, sabendo organizar por instinto, saibam organizar melhor por educação.\\nSobre o bolchevismo, por exemplo, a única coisa que há de certo é a incompetência pavorosa dos seus chefes; e isso não admira. Totalmente destituídos de cultura científica e moderna, cérebros românticos sem noção nenhuma das realidades práticas,\\ninfelizes que a irrisão do Destino atirou para a celebridade por aquele princípio há muito exposto por Shakespeare, de que «alguns nascem grandes, outros conquistam a grandeza, e a outros empurram-nos para lá». A encenação dos incompetentes é a mais cruel das ironias dos deuses.\\nVenha o que vier, por esse mundo fora, há-de ser por força transitório, absurdo, mal feito. Digo, «venha o que vier», e aplico a frase à coisa que venha — neomilitarismo, bolchevismo, industrialismo à americana, seja o que for. A falta de clareza mental e de capacidade para a acção superior, isto é, para a acção organizadora, é o característico supremo da nossa época.\\nO que há a inquirir é só isto: em que pontos deve incidir a organização preliminar? O que é que nós devemos organizar, antes de organizar qualquer coisa? Para isso, devemos, evidentemente, começar por estabelecer, para nós, quais as regras fundamentais de toda a organização. Essas regras, nem por serem intuitivas, têm sido estudadas; muita gente que, ao lê-las, dirá que já as conhece, na verdade nem as conhece a elas, nem a coisa nenhuma. O característico fundamental do incompetente é já saber o que os outros iam fazer, depois de o ver feito.\\nSão três as regras intelectuais da organização perfeita, e elas aplicam-se tanto à organização de um estado, como à de uma oficina. Elas reportam-se a qualquer coisa que se pretenda organizar — mesmo que essa coisa seja um disparate, ou um crime. Não defendo a organização para fins criminosos, ou para o intuito humaníssimo de não fazer senão asneiras; defendo, só, a organização, o princípio de organizar. (Não digo, “da organização perfeita”, porque “organizar” quer dizer “organizar perfeitamente”; organização imperfeita não é organização.)\\n\\n1.ª regra: simplificação dos fundamentos da matéria a organizar;\\n2.ª regra: colocação dos executantes da organização, a cada um no lugar que lhe compete;\\n3.ª regra: centralização dos serviços propriamente de organização.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'O fenómeno religioso é um elemento dissolvente das sociedades.\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nO fenómeno religioso é um elemento dissolvente das sociedades. Ou a religião é tradicional, e é um elemento de estagnação, de resistência ao desenvolvimento social; ou é uma religião nova e é uma perturbação social, como o foi o Cristianismo no Império Romano. O pior é que a plebe é estruturalmente religiosa, nem pode ser senão religiosa. Por isso a predominância do espírito religioso numa sociedade representa a predominância do espírito popular, a degradação do espírito de aristocracia e escol, pelo qual as sociedades se governam e progridem.\\nVemos hoje em conflito, por quase todo o mundo, e por isso entre nós também, duas religiões: o Cristianismo, progressivamente regressante ao tipo católico, e o bolchevismo. O bolchevismo (entendendo por bolchevismo o sindicalismo revolucionário e o comunismo, e não só este último) é um fenómeno reaccionário e religioso. Nada tem de propriamente social, nem podia ter, porque, se o tivesse, não o poderiam adoptar as plebes, incapazes de outra coisa que não de religião.\\nE fácil provar o carácter reaccionário do bolchevismo, como é fácil provar o seu carácter religioso — mais fácil ainda.\\nO ódio religioso é sobretudo grande de religião filha para religião mãe. O Cristianismo, que nasceu do paganismo, odiou e combateu este supremamente. O protestantismo, que nasceu do catolicismo, supremamente o odiou e o combateu. Assim se explica o ódio mortal que o bolchevismo vota ao cristianismo.\\nO bolchevismo mantém a velha mania cristã de se fazer mártir, e de inventar perseguições quando lhas não façam. Sabe-se hoje que grande parte das perseguições feitas aos cristãos — muito embora, perseguindo os cristãos, o Império Romano exercesse o que hoje se chamaria “defesa social” —  são puramente míticas, sendo das variadíssimas invenções dos propagandistas primitivos do Cristianismo.\\n\\nA nossa civilização é organicamente individualista. É-o porque assenta em dois elementos: a cultura grega, que se pode definir como sendo o individualismo racionalista, e o capitalismo moderno, em que o fenómeno concorrência é distintivo. Sempre que a civilização tentou fugir ao tipo individualista, estagnou ou perturbou-se.\\nOra o regime concorrencial, desde que chegue a um desenvolvimento intenso, torna difícil a adaptação dos fracos a ele. Torna, com o acréscimo da instrução, igualmente difícil a adaptação dos ignorantes. Por isso os débeis os incultos espontaneamente se revoltam contra ele. Revoltam-se exactamente porque são fracos, pois se fossem fortes adaptavam-se e lutavam. Revoltam-se exactamente porque são ignorantes. Revoltam-se porque têm o rancor do débil ao forte, do indolente ao activo. E como se revoltam? Revertendo espontaneamente a tipos anteriores de sociedade  — ao tipo corporativo da Idade Média, rebaptizado de sindicalismo. E é de notar que esta reversão, este ódio ao individualismo económico, se revela nas duas correntes extremas — no integralismo e no bolchevismo. E um fenómeno patentemente reaccionário.\\nBaseia-se o bolchevismo em dois dogmas —  o livre arbítrio (que supõe que o homem é quem dirige os seus destinos, e que a palavra “liberdade” tem qualquer sentido absoluto), e no milagre (pois, pretendendo construir uma sociedade fora do egoísmo, da vaidade, da cobiça humanas —  fontes de todo o progresso e de toda a vida social —, pretende por isso mesmo suspender as leis naturais, e à suspensão das leis naturais é que chamo milagre). Nestes dois dogmas — patentemente derivados do cristianismo —  assentam os dois misticismos bolchevistas.\\nO ódio feroz do bolchevismo ao cristianismo é bem o ódio de fanáticos a fanáticos, de uma religião a outra. Não nos iludamos, supondo que assistimos a uma luta de classes: continuamos na fatalidade europeia das guerras religiosas, das lutas de (...) desde que o paganismo caiu, com Juliano, e a paz religiosa abandonou o mundo.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'O meu mestre Caeiro era um mestre de toda a gente com capacidade para ter  mestre.\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nO meu mestre Caeiro era um mestre de toda a gente com capacidade para ter mestre. Não havia pessoa que se acercasse de Caeiro, que falasse com ele, que tivesse a oportunidade física de conviver com o seu espírito, que não viesse outro dessa única Roma de onde se não voltava como se ia - a não ser que essa pessoa o não fosse, isto é, a não ser que essa pessoa fosse, como a maioria, incapaz de ser individual a não ser por ser, no espaço, um corpo separado de outros corpos e estragado simbolicamente pela forma humana.\\nNenhum homem inferior pode ter um mestre, porque o mestre não tem nele nada de que o ser. É por esta razão que os temperamentos definidos e fortes são facilmente hipnotizáveis, que os homens normais o são com relativa facilidade, mas não são hipnotizáveis os idiotas, os imbecis, os fracos e os incoerentes. Ser forte é ser capaz de sentir.\\nEm torno do meu mestre Caeiro havia, como se terá depreendido destas páginas, principa1mente três pessoas - o Ricardo Reis, o António Mora e eu. Não faço favor a ninguém, nem a mim, dizendo que éramos, e somos, três indivíduos, absolutamente distintos, pelo menos pelo cérebro, da humanidade corrente e animal. E todos nós três devemos o melhor da alma que hoje temos ao nosso contacto com o meu mestre Caeiro. Todos nós somos outros - isto é, somos nós mesmos a valer - desde que fomos passados pelo passador daquela intervenção carnal dos Deuses.\\nO Ricardo Reis era um pagão latente, desentendido da vida moderna e desentendido daquela vida antiga, onde deveria ter nascido - desentendido da vida moderna porque a sua inteligência era de tipo e qualidade diferente; desentendido da vida antiga porque a não podia sentir, pois se não sente o que não está aqui. Caeiro, reconstrutor do Paganismo, ou, melhor, fundador dele no que eterno, trouxe-lhe a matéria de sensibilidade que lhe faltava. E Ricardo Reis encontrou-se o pagão que já era antes de se encontrar. Antes de conhecer Caeiro, Ricardo Reis não escrevera um único verso, e quando conheceu Caeiro tinha já vinte e cinco anos. Desde que conheceu Caeiro, e lhe ouviu o Guardador de Rebanhos, Ricardo Reis começou a saber que era organicamente poeta. Dizem alguns fisiologistas que é possível a mudança de sexo. Não sei se é verdade, porque não sei se alguma coisa é «verdade». Mas o certo é que Ricardo Reis deixou de ser mulher para ser homem, ou deixou de ser homem para ser mulher - como se preferir - quando teve esse contacto com Caeiro.\\n\\nO António Mora era uma sombra com veleidades especulativas. Passava a vida a mastigar Kant e tentar ver com o pensamento se a vida tinha sentido. Indeciso, como todos os fortes, não tinha encontrado a verdade, ou o que para ele fosse verdade, o que para mim é o mesmo. Encontrou Caeiro e encontrou a verdade. O meu mestre Caeiro deu-lhe a alma que ele não tinha; pôs dentro do Mora periférico, que ele sempre tinha apenas sido, um Mora central. E o resultado foi a redução a sistema e a verdade lógica dos pensamentos instintivos de Caeiro. O resultado triunfal foi esses dois tratados, maravilhas de originalidade e de pensamento, O \\n\\nRegresso dos Deuses \\n\\ne os \\n\\nProlegómenos a uma Reformação do Paganismo.\\n\\n\\nPor mim, antes de conhecer Caeiro, eu era uma máquina nervosa de não fazer coisa nenhuma. Conheci o meu mestre Caeiro mais tarde que o Reis e o Mora, que o conheceram, respectivamente, em 1912 e 1913. Conheci Caeiro em 1914. Já tinha escrito versos - três sonetos e dois poemas («Carnaval» e «Opiário»). Esses sonetos e estes poemas mostram o que eu sentia quando estava sem amparo. Logo que conheci Caeiro, verifiquei-me. Cheguei a Londres e escrevi imediatamente a «Ode Triunfal«. E de aí em diante, por mal ou por bem, tenho sido eu.\\nMais curioso é o caso do Fernando Pessoa, que não existe, propriamente falando. Este conheceu Caeiro um pouco antes de mim - em 8 de Março de 1914, segundo me disse. Nesse mês, Caeiro viera a Lisboa passar uma semana e foi então que o Fernando o conheceu. Ouviu ler o Guardador de Rebanhos.Foi para casa com febre, e escreveu, num só lance ou traço, a Chuva Oblíqua. A Chuva Oblíqua não se parece em nada com qualquer poema do meu mestre Caeiro, a não ser em certa rectilineadade do movimento rítmico. Mas o Fernando Pessoa era incapaz de arrancar aqueles extraordinários poemas do seu mundo interior se não tivesse conhecido Caeiro. Mas, momentos depois de conhecer Caeiro, sofreu o abalo espiritual que produziu esses poemas. Foi logo. Como tem uma sensibilidade excessivamente pronta, porque acompanhada de uma inteligência excessivamente pronta, o Fernando teve sem demora a reacção à Grande Vacina - a vacina contra a estupidez dos inteligentes. E o que há de mais admirável na obra do Fernando Pessoa é esse conjunto de seis poemas, essa Chuva Oblíqua. Sim, poderá haver ou vir a haver, coisas maiores na obra dele, mas mais originais nunca haverá, mais novas nunca haverá, e eu não sei portanto se as haverá maiores. E, mais, não haverá nada de mais realmente Fernando Pessoa, de mais intimamente Fernando Pessoa. Que coisa pode exprimir melhor a sensibilidade sempre intelectualizada, a atenção intensa e desatenta, a subtileza quente da análise fria de si mesmo, do que esses poemas-intersecções, onde o estado de alma é simultaneamente dois, onde o subjectivo e o objectivo, separados, se juntam, e ficam separados, onde o real e o irreal se confundem, para que fiquem bem distintos. Fernando Pessoa fez nesses poemas a verdadeira fotografia da própria alma. Num momento, num único momento, conseguiu ter a sua individualidade que não tivera antes nem poderá tornar a ter, porque a não tem.\\nViva o meu mestre Caeiro!\\n',\n",

Por sua própria natureza de natural, ele pode aparecer e desaparecer, mas não mudar de qualidade. «Neopagão» é um termo que tem tanto sentido como «neopedra» ou «neoflor». O paganismo aparece com a saúde, desaparece com o adoecimento, do género humano. Pode estiolar-se, como uma flor se estiola, e morrer, como morre uma planta. Mas não toma a forma de outra coisa, nem é susceptível de formas diferentes da sua substância.\\nQue se designassem, a si mesmos, neopagãos aqueles cristãos rebeldes, como Pater e Swinburne, que nada tinham de pagãos, senão o desejo de o ser — conceda-se porque não é falta de razão que se dê um nome impossível a uma coisa absurda. Mas nós, que somos pagãos, não podemos usar um nome que indique que o somos como «modernos», ou que viemos «reformar», ou «reconstruir» o paganismo dos gregos. Viemos ser pagãos. Renasceu em nós, o paganismo. Mas o paganismo que renasceu em nós é o paganismo que sempre houve — a subordinação aos deuses como a justiça da Terra para consigo mesma.\\nUm estudioso do paganismo não é um pagão. Um pagão não é humanista: é humano. O que o pagão de melhor grado aceita ao cristismo é a fé popular nos milagres e nos santos, o rito, as romarias. É a parte «rejeitada» do Cristismo que ele mais prontamente aceitaria, se alguma coisa cristã aceitasse. Aquele «paganismo» moderno, ou «neopaganismo», que não compreende os dias santos, mas sim os poetas místicos, nada tem de comum com o paganismo. Porque o pagão aceita uma procissão sem desagrado mas vira as costas à mística de Santa Teresa de Jesus. A interpretação cristã do mundo causa-lhe náuseas; mas uma festa de igreja, com luzes, flores, cantos e depois a romaria — estas coisas ele aceita como boas, ainda que numa coisa má, porque estas coisas são da verdade humana, e são a interpretação pagã do Cristianismo.\\nO pagão tem simpatia pela superstição cristã, porque o homem que não é supersticioso não é homem; mas não sente simpatia pelo humanitarismo, porque quem é humanitário não é homem.\\n\\nPara o pagão cada coisa tem o seu génio ou ninfa, cada coisa é uma ninfa cativa ou uma dríade apanhada pelo olhar; por isso cada objecto tem para ele uma\\n\\n \\n\\nespantosa realidade imediata, e com cada coisa ele está em convívio quando a vê, e em amizade, quando lhe toca.\\n\\nO homem que vê em cada objecto uma outra coisa qualquer, que não seja isto, não pode ver, amar ou sentir esse objecto. O que dá a cada coisa o valor de ter sido criada por «Deus», dá-lhe o valor por o que ela não é, mas por o que ela lembra. Os seus olhos estão postos nessa coisa, e alhures o seu pensamento.\\n\\nO panteísta, para quem cada coisa vale pela sua participação no \\n\\ntodo, \\n\\npor igual vê uma coisa para pensar noutra, por igual olha para não ver. Não pensa nela, mas na continuidade dela com o resto do mundo. Como pode amar uma coisa quem a ama por um princípio externo a ela? A primeira regra do amor, e a última, é que a coisa amada seja amada por ser essa coisa e não outra, e amada por ser objecto de amor, não por\\n\\n \\n\\nhaver «razão» para amá-la.\\n\\nO mero materialista ou racionalista, para quem cada coisa é maravilhosa pelo trabalho que nela teve a «Natureza», e a energia latente que nela se agita, para que vive [?] — o sistema planetário que cada átomo nela inclui — este homem não ama essa coisa, nem a vê, este por igual, quando olha uma coisa, pensa em outra, que é a composição [?] dessa coisa. Quando vê uma coisa, medita a decomposição dela. Por isso nunca um materialista fez arte, nunca um materialista, ou um racionalista, olhou para o mundo. Entre ele e o mundo o misticismo da ciência interpôs o seu véu, o microscópio, e ele caiu na realidade como num poço. Para ele cada coisa se tornou [. ] uma grade, por onde espreita a sua atenção íntima; como para o panteísta ela é uma grade ou janela para o Todo; e para o criacionista uma grade através da qual ele olha para o Deus [...]\\nMísticos cristãos, sonhador panteísta, materialista e homem da «razão», para eles todos o mundo é apenas o seu pensamento [... ]\\n',\n",

O mal d'stes homens todos - do Ricardo Reis, do António Mora, do Fernando Pessoa, sim, porque sinto outside idolatry, do meu mestre Caeiro também - é que só vêem a realidade. Diversamente, todos a vêem com clareza; todos são objectivistas, até o Fernando Pessoa, que é subjectivista também. Mas eu não só vejo a realidade - palpo-a. Por isso eles são, mais ou menos declaradamente, politeístas, e eu sou monoteísta. É que o mundo considerado com a vista é de uma essencial diversidade. Considerado com o tacto, não tem diversidade nenhuma. Eles são todos, diversamente, mais inteligentes do que eu, mas eu sou mais profundamente prático do que eles todos. Por isso creio em Deus. Às vezes penso que Milton só pôde ascender a um sentimento sublime da Divindade quando, privado da vista, voltou à grande primitividade do tacto, à grande unidade da matéria. E o próprio Satan, que não é senão Deus em sua sombra disforme, lançada pela luz do aparente, não o pôde ele tão fortemente conceber senão quando os olhos se lhe haviam tornado noite.\\nA variedade do mundo não é variedade senão por contraposição subentendida a uma unidade qualquer.

       "  'text': '\\nA lucidez, a sobriedade, a concisão não são postulados, são corolários do classicismo pagão. O pagão é naturalmente conciso, sóbrio e lúcido, mas apenas porque é tudo isso por ser outra coisa de que isso é a manifestação mais natural. O essencial, porém, é a harmonia, a unidade e a coordenação da obra. Píndaro não é lúcido. Heraclito é conhecido por «o obscuro». De Aristófanes não se pode dizer que tivesse um grande respeito pela simplicidade ou pela sobriedade, sobretudo na estruturação verbal.\\nImporta que esta distinção se faça, para que se não confunda, não já a essência com os seus atributos, porque os atributos são, afinal, a essência vista de outro modo; mas a causa de uma manifestação com as condições em que ela se manifesta (mais naturalmente). \\n(?)\\nHá ideias, por exemplo as vagas, que não comportam uma apresentação lúcida. Há sentimentos, por exemplo os desmarcados, que não admitem uma manifestação sóbria. Há pontos em que nem é útil, nem possível ser conciso, como aqueles em que a explanação é de um assunto complexo, ou a demonstração de um assunto controverso, onde as objecções hão-de ser previstas e respondidas, e as diversas formas da interpretação revistas e classificadas.\\nEu não defendo a falta de lucidez, a falta de sobriedade, ou a falta de concisão. Quero, porém, indicar que essas qualidades, sendo naturais no pagão, não são essenciais nele. Era preciso que não houvesse confusão neste respeito.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*\\n\\nDe que modo, porém, é que se pode pensar em aplicar o paganismo à sociedade moderna? Respondamos: que razões há para que ele se não aplique? Só pode haver três; examinemo-las. A primeira é que, por uma variedade de causas (económicas, políticas e outras) não há semelhança entre a sociedade antiga e a moderna, e a fé, e os princípios dela resultantes, que se aplicavam às sociedades antigas, não podem ter aplicação nas sociedades modernas. A segunda é que o cristismo, ele e os seus atributos, são a nossa tradição; podem ser decadentes, podem ser maléficos, podem ser prejudiciais, mas existem: criaram um estado de espírito seu, que se torna incompatível com a aplicação do paganismo. A terceira razão é que (...)\\nQuais são as causas actuantes que podem ser concebidas como dificultantes do paganismo? Uma é o cosmopolitismo criado pela causação económica actual; outra o imperialismo gerado pela existência de colónias, quando por mais não fosse; outra a importância tomada pelo proletariado na nossa época. Repare-se que cuidadosamente distinguimos entre os efeitos produzidos por causação económica natural e directa; e os produzidos pelo cristismo, que já devidamente estudámos no decurso deste opúsculo. Assim, uma coisa é o cosmopolitismo do espírito cristão, sobretudo manifestado pela religião católica, pelo cristismo em geral; outra o cosmopolitismo que provém do facto, puramente laico, digamos, da extensão e multiplicação de relações e correlações comerciais e industriais da época presente. Do mesmo modo, uma coisa é o imperialismo cristista, que lhe vem (como vimos) da sua herança romana, e outra coisa o imperialismo que decorre das descobertas, da posse de colónias, sobretudo as que se não admitir que recebam, num governo autónomo, uma preparação para a nacionalidade independente. E identicamente, são duas coisas diversas o espírito igualitário do cristismo, essénio na sua origem, decadente romano na sua posse das almas, e o espírito igualitário que o regime de concorrência criou na nossa época mercantil.\\nPor ora, na análise da objecção tirada das qualidades naturais da nossa época, é das segundas, das citadas condições, que tratamos. \\nTemos, pois, a hipótese que o paganismo não possa ajustar-se ao cosmopolitismo económico contemporâneo Mas o paganismo não se ajusta a ele: corrige-o dando força às nacionalidades.\\n',\n",

Uma alteração radical de um sistema qualquer, económico ou outro, supõe não só a força para o destruir, como também a capacidade para lhe substituir outro. Admitindo que o proletariado tenha a força para substituir o actual regime económico, pode crer-se que tenha a competência para lhe substituir qualquer outro, aquele mesmo que desejam substituir-lhe? O proletariado é de todas as classes sociais a mais ignorante e inculta. Não será por sua culpa que o é, porém o facto é que o é. Para uma obra construtiva de natureza intelectual, como é a criação de um regime qualquer, falta-lhe portanto a base intelectual. Acresce que o proletariado está por natureza historicamente afastado do governo, de qualquer tipo que seja; está inadaptado a governar. Falta-lhe portanto a base, por assim dizer, orgânica. Só tem a seu favor o ter interesse em efectuar essa mudança; porém o interesse em uma coisa nem pressupõe a competência para entender nela, pois o doente, sendo quem mais interesse tem em ser curado, nem por isso entende mais da doença do que o médico, que a não tem.\\nNem eles, nem os seus dirigentes governam, não têm tradições mas não podem portanto saber [...] governar para manter o que é, [...] quanto mais governar para transformar, o que exige\\n[...]\\nÉ então uma terceira classe, que nem é bem a classe capitalista, nem ao certo o proletariado? Suponhamos que é, e que essa classe é ou uma classe de técnicos, ou uma classe de proletários intelectualizados, ou qualquer outra assim. Seja qual for, seja o que for, ou essa classe se subordina ao proletariado, ou não. Se se subordina, é o mesmo que fosse o próprio operariado; e o argumento empregado contra este aplica-se àquela. Se não se subordina, porém se lhe impõe, é por uma de duas razões que o faz: ou por influir nele e em absoluto se lhe impor, ou por ser geralmente aceite por ele. Se é por se lhe impor por influência, que garantia tem o proletariado que essa classe, uma vez que fosse efectuada a revolução social, serviria o proletariado, a quem se impõe, e não interesses seus apenas? Não sendo aceite espontaneamente pelo proletariado, prova-se que ela lhe fica sempre estranha. Sendo estranha na oposição e na propaganda, muito mais estranha ficará quando entre os dois se abrir o abismo do poder. Trata-se, então, de uma classe geralmente aceite pelo proletariado? Aceite como? Por se identificar com ele em tudo? Estamos no caso anterior, e essa classe, na verdade fundida no operariado, é como que parte dele, e o argumento dirigido contra o proletariado como agente da transformação social prevalece contra esta classe postiça. E por ser por ele aceite como intelectualmente superior e apta a representar as suas aspirações e pô-las em prática? Que competência tem quem é estúpido para avaliar da inteligência alheia? que competência quem é inculto para avaliar da cultura de outrem? que competência quem é inexperiente na arte de governar e de dirigir para avaliar da experiência de outrem nessas artes, sendo que, ainda, esses tais nem sequer governaram ainda? Quem se impõe à aceitação dos estúpidos, dos incultos, dos inexperientes e incompetentes, força é que se lhes torne ou acessível, ou estimável. Quem é na verdade superior em inteligência não pode tornar-se acessível aos inferiores, nem se ajeita a tornar-se-lhes estimável. Em matéria intelectual não tem o operário inteligência a que apelar [?] [...]\\nDe aqui se conclui que não há classe social nenhuma competente, ou por carência de interesse ou por carência de habilidade, para efectuar a transformação económica que os radicais desejam que se realize.

       "  'text': \"\\n\\nOs tempos novos, com o aumento da erudição extensa e aquela maior relação com os países antigos distantes, pela qual essa erudição compreende mais culturas ou é levada a compreendê-las, trouxeram um novo período à história da vida religiosa. Abandonou-se aquela restrita crítica do Cristianismo, que consistira principalmente na análise racional, por vezes estulta e pobre, dos seus dogmas, e na crítica social, por vezes estreita e fria das suas doutrinas. Aumentou o respeito pelas religiões, reconhecidas como gerais na humanidade, mas o crédito dado a esta ou àquela religião diminuiu com a comparação com as outras. Antes, procurava-se fazer aluir a metafísica do Cristianismo, ou a moral do Cristianismo, por uma crítica directa delas; hoje, essa metafísica e essa moral são aluídas, insensivelmente, indirectamente, por outro processo: a verificação de que há muitas outras metafísicas religiosas, às quais a do Cristianismo não sobreleva em sentido nenhum racional, muitas outras éticas que a do Cristianismo não supera em ternura, em beleza ou em efeito. Antes, o homem europeu ou cria ou descria, porque, confrontando somente com o Cristianismo, ou cria nele ou em parte dele ou em nada. Hoje, o homem europeu, conhecedor de cinco ou seis sistemas religiosos, pode\\n\\n \\n\\ndescrer do Cristianismo para crer em qualquer dos outros sistemas; ou, não crendo em nenhum, tem todavia uma visão mais larga da importância da religião entre a humanidade, uma mais larga tolerância daqueles mesmos abusos e crueldades que quase se consideravam próprios do Cristianismo, por isso que, como religião, só propriamente o Cristianismo, ou o hebraismo anterior, se conhecia. Esta emergência de diversos sistemas religiosos teve um resultado particular: o erguer o paganismo dos gregos e dos romanos à superfície; e ele passou de um fenómeno morto do passado a um fenómeno religioso a ser considerado, na ordem lógica, em paralelo com o Cristianismo. Pode dizer-se que o paganismo deixou de ser anterior ao Cristianismo, tomando lugar ao lado dele, e de todas as mais religiões estudadas, num panteão sem jerarquias. Desde esse momento passou a ser possível um repensamento do paganismo; e, como o paganismo foi a antiga fé das culturas que animam a nossa civilização, passou a ser possível não só repensar, mas até reconstruir, o paganismo. Uma nova era pagã se tornou possível.\\n\\n\\nÉ\\n\\n \\n\\nde uso corrente, sobretudo entre os sequazes das seitas crististas, empregar a palavra «pagão» como termo descritivo de ausência de religião, ou como reles e baixo materialismo na vida. Importa, antes de mais nada, que repudiemos essa aplicação do termo, em comparação com a qual poderíamos, lembrados da Inquisição e das guerras religiosas, descrever o Cristianismo como a religião da crueldade e do sangue, ou, lembrados das festas de igreja e das romarias, como a religião da alegria animal sem devoção nem caridade. Longe de designar uma ausência de religião, ou um baixo materialismo, o paganismo designa um sistema religioso completo, e o baixo materialismo e, mais ainda, a falta de religião não podem ser descritivos de uma religião qualquer. É só quando considerado em relação absurda com a espiritualidade cristã que o paganismo parece um baixo materialismo, mas nem faltou o que se chama espiritualidade ao paganismo, senão nos seus baixos exemplos — de que há iguais no Cristianismo —, nem a espiritualidade é muito acentuada nas populações cristãs. Compara-se o que o paganismo foi com o que o Cristianismo queria ser; comparação cómoda, mas pela qual se prova que qualquer coisa é superior a outra qualquer coisa.\\n\\nO paganismo nem é materialista nem é estreito: é simplesmente o conceito do universo que estabelece, acima de tudo, a existência de um Destino implacável e abstracto, a que homens e deuses estão igualmente sujeitos; abaixo desse destino, a raça dos deuses e a dos homens, distintas em grau mas não em qualidade,\\n\\nambas compostas por seres imperfeitos, ambas eivadas de injustiça e de capricho. O paganismo é isto, e disto derivam todas as fórmulas pagãs: a vulgar, que oferece sacrifícios aos deuses e tenta propiciá-los, pois que, não sendo melhores que nós, são todavia mais poderosos; a chamada epicurista, que, considerando que os deuses não curam\\n\\n \\n\\nde nós e o Destino é inumano e indivino, acha que\\n\\n \\n\\na vida não merece outra consideração que não um humilde estudo de como a poderemos passar com menos dor — pelo prazer intenso e breve, ou pelo longo equilíbrio dos prazeres —; e a chamada estóica, que acha que ao homem compete, como homem, submeter-se ao Destino e aos Deuses; como deus virtual, ter o orgulho intelectual de conhecer a necessidade dessa submissão. Pode alegar-se que o fundo do paganismo é triste; e deveras o é. Mas o pagão é um objectivo: vê as coisas e aceita-as, nem julga que serve de alguma coisa o criar ilusões para se julgar feliz. Foi o Cristianismo que trouxe à civilização ocidental a necessidade de substituir o universo. Não seremos injustos se dissermos que o Cristianismo foi, na civilização europeia, a primeira forma conhecida do ópio ou da cocaína.\\n\\n\\nReconhecer que não sabemos nada, salvo que há uma lei\\n\\n \\n\\nem tudo — lei que se manifesta alheia às nossas dores e aos nossos prazeres, além do bem e do mal; que somos, abaixo dessa lei, joguetes nas mãos de forças superiores que não conhecem perfeição moral, como nós a não conhecemos entre nós; que, visto que só o universo objectivo nos foi dado, é nesse universo e em conformação com esse universo que devemos viver a nossa vida, pois, se outras formas de vida pudermos ter a seu tempo as teremos ou nos serão dadas — nisto consiste a religião pagã, ou, se se preferir, a filosofia do paganismo\\n\\nSupõem alguns que o paganismo é mais alegre que o Cristianismo, outros que ele é mais humano. Ambas as suposições são falsas: o paganismo é simplesmente mais objectivo e mais lógico que o Cristianismo. O Cristianismo é forçosamente mais alegre do que o paganismo, porque o Cristianismo promete uma felicidade eterna, e o paganismo não promete nada; e o Cristianismo é forçosamente mais humano que o paganismo, pois o Cristianismo considera o homem como um valor eterno, ao passo que o paganismo o não considera senão como um episódio da terra. '\\nO erro nasce, talvez, da grande atenção que o paganismo presta ao corpo humano, por uma parte; e, por outra parte, da insistência das sociedades pagãs na vida cívica. Mas a atenção dada ao corpo humano é tão somente um critério objectivo, a atenção dada à única certeza exterior humana que se possui. Mas a atenção dada à vida cívica nada tem que ver com a «fraternidade» ou a «solidariedade» em que hoje se fala — produtos do Cristianismo — mas tão somente significa o conhecimento de que o homem nasce em sociedade e tem de se conformar — não por interesse, não por amor, não por dever mesmo — com a existência dessa sociedade. O paganismo não é um humanismo: é uma aceitação.\\n\\n[ms.]: A ferocidade materialista de muitos factos [?] do nosso tempo não é paganismo nem sequer [?] virtualmente: é simplesmente anti-Cristianismo.\\n\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Os grandes movimentos revolucionários...\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\nOs grandes movimentos revolucionários — quer se concretizem em convulsões sociais, quer apenas se manifestem em ideias que tendem para essas convulsões — derivam sempre de um sentimento nítido e portanto certo, de uma injustiça, e de uma ideia vaga, e portanto errada, do modo de remediar essa injustiça. Todos os grandes movimentos revolucionários existem, portanto, em virtude de uma razão sentimental a que se junta uma sem-razão intelectual. Por isso eles são simultaneamente defensáveis e absurdos; defensáveis quando se olha às injustiças e às tiranias, que os causam e possibilitam; absurdos, quando se analisam as ideias, sempre excessivas e inaplicáveis, que pretendem pôr em prática.\\nNão há grande movimento revolucionário — isto é, movimento revolucionário extenso e profundo — que seja possível sem uma razão qualquer. Não há revoluções feitas por mera leitura de livros, por mera influência de ideias, por mera insinuação de oradores. Os homens são, de seu natural, inertes e misoneicos. O homem é um animal com hábitos, como os outros animais; mas o homem tem, além dos hábitos propriamente ditos, outra espécie de hábitos chamados tradições. Dificilmente as quebra; dificilmente se une para as quebrar; dificilmente se ergue contra os seus semelhantes nacionais e sociais, com raiva e ódio, para as quebrar.\\nÉ preciso, por isso, que a doutrina revolucionária, uma vez lançada, encontre eco no coração humano. Ir dizer a um povo, que não tem fome, que se revolte porque a tem, pode fazer um ou outro convertido, entre os que realmente têm fome, e entre os que julgam que a têm; mas um tal movimento não logra por certo o número de aderentes precisos para que converta em revolução.\\nHá sempre, é claro, argumentos possíveis para casos destes. Em todas as épocas houve ricos e pobres, e em todas as épocas houve uma certa injustiça evidente na distribuição da riqueza. Mas — embora em todas as épocas houvesse quem pregasse a revolta contra os ricos, nem em todas essa revolta congregou adeptos em número que roçasse pelo considerável. Em todas as épocas houve uma certa injustiça política e social, à parte riqueza; mas, embora em todas as épocas surgisse quem flagelasse essas injustiças sociais, nem em todas congregou adeptos essa indignação.\\nPor força, pois que havia em certas épocas condições especiais que fizeram com que calasse no animo das multidões, por infiltração lenta, certa teorização contra a injustiça. E quando a injustiça se tornou um sistema, como na França do ancien régime, em que já não havia diferenças sociais pronunciadas, mas um uso constantemente tirânico das diferenças sociais pronunciadas; e como na Rússia dos Czares, em que a tirania era não um acaso do desgoverno, mas uma modalidade substância do governo que havia.\\nPara que a injustiça seja geralmente sentida como tal, não basta, porém, que simplesmente exista. O ancien régime, quando caiu era já velho, e sempre havia sido tirânico; a tirania czarista não era de ontem, nem de antes de ontem.\\nPara que a injustiça seja sentida como tal, e dê portanto azo à formação do espírito de revolta, é preciso que perca a base por onde existia. O czarismo não caiu só por ser tirânico, mas porque, sobre ser tirânico, perdeu o consenso geral. Quando o czar era na verdade o representante sentimental do povo russo, todas as tiranias eram possíveis em seu nome, porque a sua autoridade, inclusive para praticá-las, era aceite geralmente.\\nLevantam-se vozes a clamar contra a injustiça. Ora um poder injustamente injusto implica um governo ou instituição desadaptada do meio. Um governo desadaptado do meio implica um governo-incapaz de acção coerente e forte. Um governo incapaz de acção coerente e forte perante ataques à sua constituição, alternadamente os tolera e os persegue com violência. E quer pela tolerância, quer pela perseguição, a voz que clama ganha alento.\\nPor fim a onda revolucionária triunfa — ou por um impulso de reforma, se há ainda no sistema vigente forças de adaptação; ou por força da violência se esse regime não se adapta; e então segue a anarquia que havia, porque a lei da continuidade histórica não admite revoluções capazes de transformar nada. A anarquia revolucionária é sempre o seguimento da anarquia disfarçada que a precedeu. Não há revoluções contra organizadores. Há só revoluções contra desorganizados. Isto é, a desorganização de um país mal governado, quando produz uma revolução, prolonga-se, não se transforma. Assim, quem não vê a perfeita continuidade piorada de processos — do ancien régime para o terror, do czarismo para o bolchevismo, da monarquia de D. Carlos e de D. Manuel II para a triste república portuguesa?\\nVisando o estabelecimento da liberdade, a Revolução Francesa suprimiu-a toda; inverteu os termos da opressão, nada mais. Visando a liberdade, a libertação dos operários e dos fracos o bolchevismo oprimiu outros fracos e não aos que disse servir desoprimiu. Visando a reformar uma administração corrupta, e subverter uma semitirania política, a República Portuguesa instaurou uma administração mais corrupta ainda, uma semitirania por certo ainda mais opressiva.\\nIsto está na fatalidade das revoluções, que, como derivam de uma inadaptação, são fenómenos doentios (...)\\nAs ideias revolucionárias —  ou nasçam da própria injustiça que motiva o sentimento revolucionário, ou sejam estranhas a ele e por ele adaptadas —  são sempre absurdas; são-no por duas razões.\\nAs revoluções, como vimos, baseiam-se num sentimento forte de injustiça, sentimento que se torna geral. Ora um sentimento geral e forte de injustiça gera por força ideias absurdas. Em 1.º lugar, um sentimento forte é uma condição negativa para a lucidez; quem estuda apaixonadamente (salvo no sentido de entusiasmo intelectual) um problema, estuda-o sempre mal. Em 2.º lugar, um sentimento de injustiça envolve sempre um ódio ou rancor a quem a pratica; e a teoria nascida, ou adaptada, por esse sentimento tenderá fatalmente a ser excessiva no sentido contrário — não só a desfazer a injustiça, como a castigá-la, isto é, a ferir e vingar-se nos que a praticam, ou se supõe que a praticam. Resultará uma teoria tão injusta como a prática a que essa teoria se contrapõe. Em 3.º lugar, os problemas que uma revolução busca resolver são sempre problemas sociais, todos, por natureza, de uma grande complexidade. Ora, uma teoria de contra-injustiça, para ser geralmente sentida, tem que ser simples; porque o geral da humanidade não pode compreender ideias complexas. A teoria tem portanto que ser inadaptável à complexidade do problema.\\nPor isso, de toda e qualquer ideia revolucionária se pode afirmar mas sem se saber qual é, mas sabendo só que é revolucionária, que é falsa; mas também se pode afirmar, se foi aceite por muitos, se serviu de estímulo a movimentos e agitações, que teve uma razão sentimental de existir, e que há uma injustiça a reparar, uma reforma a fazer.\\nEstudar qual essa reforma é que é, em qualquer caso, o papel —  em geral inútil — do sociólogo.\\nUma revolução verdadeiramente tal não falha nunca; as ideias revolucionárias falham sempre.\\nFinalmente estabelece-se o equilíbrio, e vê-se que o que resultou da revolução, das contra-revoluções e tudo isso, foi uma diagonal a esse paralelogramo de forças — direcção social que não é nem a que estava, nem a que está. \\nO papel do homem de ciência — livre dos preconceitos revolucionários, absurdos todos porque são revolucionámos; livre também dos preconceitos contra-revolucionários, porque, por idêntica razão, são igualmente absurdos, é preestabelecer a hipótese de equilíbrio final.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'É costume dizer-se, desde que alguém começou a dizê-lo,\\n',\n",
       "  'text': '\\n\\n\\nÉ \\n\\ncostume dizer-se, desde que alguém começou a dizê-lo, que, para compreender um sistema filosófico, é preciso compreender o temperamento do filósofo. Como todas as coisas com ar de cenas, e que se espalham, isto é asneira; se o não fosse, não se teria espalhado. Confunde-se a filosofia com a formação dela. O meu temperamento pode levar-me a dizer que dois e dois são cinco, mas a afirmação de que dois e dois são cinco é falsa independentemente do meu temperamento, seja ele qual for. Pode ser interessante saber como é que eu vim a afirmar essa falsidade, mas isso nada tem com a própria falsidade, tem que ver somente com a razão do seu aparecimento.\\n\\nO meu mestre Caeiro era um temperamento sem filosofia, e por isso a filosofia dele - que a tinha, como toda a gente - não é susceptível sequer destas brincadeiras do jornalismo intelectual. Não há dúvida que, sendo um temperamento, isto é, sendo um poeta, o meu mestre Caeiro exprimiu uma filosofia, isto é, um conceito do universo. Esse conceito do universo é, porém, instintivo e não intelectual; não pode ser criticado como conceito, porque não está lá, e não pode ser criticado como temperamento, porque o temperamento não é criticável.\\nAs ideias organicamente ocultas na expressão poética do meu mestre Caeiro tentaram definir-se, com maior ou menor felicidade lógica, em certas teorias do Ricardo Reis, em certas teorias minhas, e no sistema filosófico - esse perfeitamente definido - do António Mora. Tão fecundo é Caeiro que cada um de nós três, devendo todos o pensamento da alma ao nosso mestre comum, produziu uma interpretação da vida inteiramente diferente da de qualquer dos outros dois. Verdadeiramente, não há direito de comparar a minha metafísica, e a do Ricardo Reis, que são meras vaguidades poéticas tentando esclarecer-se (ao contrário de em Caeiro, onde a alma era de certezas poéticas não buscando esclarecer-se), com o sistema de António Mora, que é realmente um sistema, e não uma atitude ou um remexer. Mas, enfim, ao passo que Caeiro afirmava coisas que, estando todas certas umas com as outras (como todos percebíamos) numa lógica que excede - como uma pedra ou uma árvore - a nossa compreensão, não eram contudo coerentes na sua superfície lógica, tanto o Reis, como eu (não falemos no Mora, por nosso superior em qualidade nesta matéria) tentávamos encontrar uma coerência lógica no que pensávamos, ou supunhamos que pensávamos, a respeito do Mundo. E isso, que pensávamos ou supunhamos que pensávamos, a respeito do mundo, isso devíamos a Caeiro, descobridor das nossas almas, colonizadas depois por nós.\\nPropriamente falando, Reis, Mora e eu somos três interpretações orgânicas de Caeiro. Reis e eu, que somos fundamentalmente embora diversamente poetas, interpretamos ainda com sujidades do sentimento. Mora, puramente intelectual, interpreta com a razão; se tem sentimento, ou temperamento, anda disfarçado.\\nO conceito da vida, formado por Ricardo Reis, vê-se muito claramente nas suas odes, pois, quaisquer que sejam os seus defeitos, o Reis é sempre claro. Esse conceito da vida é absolutamente nenhum, ao contrário do de Caeiro, que também é nenhum, mas às avessas. Para Ricardo Reis, nada se pode saber do universo, excepto que nos foi dado como real um universo material. Sem necessariamente aceitarmos como real esse universo, temos que o aceitar como tal, pois não nos foi dado outro. Temos que viver nesse universo, sem metafísica, sem moral, sem sociologia nem política. Conformemo-nos com esse universo externo, o único que temos, assim como nos conformariamos com o poder absoluto de um rei, sem discutir se é bom ou mau, mas simplesmente porque é o que é. Reduzamos a nossa acção ao mínimo, fechando-nos quanto possível nos instintos que nos foram dados, e usando-os de modo a produzir o menos desconforto para nós e para os outros, pois tem igual direito a não ter desconforto. Moral negativa, mas clara. Comamos, bebamos e amemos (sem nos prender sentimentalmente à comida, à bebida e ao amor, pois isso traria mais tarde elementos de desconforto); a vida é um dia, e a noite é certa; não façamos a ninguém nem bem nem mal, pois não sabemos o que é bem ou mal, e nem sequer sabemos se fazemos um quando supomos fazer o outro, a verdade, se existe, é com os Deuses, ou seja com as forças que formaram ou criaram, ou governam, o mundo - forças que, como na sua acção violam todas as nossas ideias do que é moral e todas as nossas ideias do que é imoral, estão patentemente além ou fora de qualquer conceito do bem ou do mal, nada havendo a esperar delas para nosso bem ou até para mal nosso. Nem crença na verdade, nem crença na mentira; nem optimismo nem pessimismo. Nada: a paisagem, um copo de vinho, um pouco de amor sem amor, e a vaga tristeza de nada compreender e de ter que perder o pouco que nos é dado. Tal é a filosofia de Ricardo Reis. É a de Caeiro endurecida, falsificada pela estilização. Mas é absolutamente a de Caeiro, de outro modo: o aspecto côncavo daquele mesmo arco de que a de Caeiro é o aspecto convexo, o fechar-se sobre si mesmo daquilo que em Caeiro está virado para o Infinito - sim, para o mesmo infinito que nega.\\nÉ isto - este conceito tão fundamente negativo das coisas - que dá à poesia de Ricardo Reis aquela dureza, aquela frieza, que ninguém negará que tem, por mais que a admire; e quem a admira - pouca gente - é por essa mesma frieza, aliás, que a admira. Nisto, de resto, Caeiro e Reis são iguais, com a diferença que Caeiro tem frieza sem dureza; que Caeiro, que é a infância filosófica da atitude de Reis, tem a frieza de uma estátua ou de um píncaro nevado, e Reis tem a frieza de um belo túmulo ou de um maravilhoso rochedo sem sol nem onde haver musgos. E é por isto que, sendo a poesia de Reis rigorosamente clássica na forma, é totalmente destituída de vibração - mais ainda que a de Horácio, apesar do maior conteúdo emotivo e intelectual. A tal ponto é intelectual, e portanto fria, a poesia de Reis, que quem não compreender um poema dele (o que facilmente sucede, dada a excessiva compressão) não lhe apreende o ritmo.\\nComigo o que se passou foi o mesmo que o que se passou com Ricardo Reis, com a diferença que foi o contrário. O Reis é um intelectual, com o mínimo de sensibilidade de que um intelectual precisa para que a sua inteligência não seja simplesmente matemática, com o mínino do que ente humano precisa para se poder verificar pelo termómetro que não está morto. Eu sou exasperadamente sensível e exasperadamente inteligente. Nisto pareço-me (salvo um bocado mais de sensibilidade, e um bocado menos de inteligência) com o Fernando Pessoa; mas, ao passo que no Fernando a sensibilidade e a inteligência entrepenetram-se, confundem-se, interseccionam-se, em mim existem paralelamente, ou, melhor, sobrepostamente. Não são cônjuges, mas gémeos desavindos. Assim, expontaneamente formei a minha filosofia daquela parte da insinuação de Caeiro de que Ricardo Reis não tirou nada. Refiro-me à parte de Caeiro que está integralmente contida naquele verso, «E os meus pensamentos são todos sensações»; o Ricardo Reis deriva a sua alma daquele outro verso, que Caeiro se esqueceu de escrever, «as minhas sensações são todas pensamentos». Quando me designei como «sensacionista» ou «poeta sensacionista» não quis empregar uma expressão de escola poética (santo Deus! escola!); a palavra tem um sentido filosófico.\\nNão creio em nada senão na existência das minhas sensações; não tenho outra certeza, nem a do tal universo exterior que essas sensações me apresentam. Eu não vejo o universo exterior, eu não oiço o universo exterior, eu não palpo o universo exterior. Vejo as minhas impressões visuais; oiço as minhas impressões auditivas; palpo as minhas impressões tácteis. Não é com os olhos que vejo, mas com a alma; não é com os ouvidos que oiço, mas com a alma; não é com a pele que palpo, é com [a alma.] E, se me perguntarem o que é a alma, respondo que sou eu. De aqui a minha divergência fundamental do fundamental intelectual de Caeiro e de Reis, mas não do fundamental instintivo e sensitivo em Caeiro. Para mim o universo é apenas um conceito meu, uma síntese dinâmica e projectada de todas as minhas sensações. Verifico, ou cuido verificar, que coincidem com as minhas grande número das sensações de outras almas, e a essa coincidência chamo o universo exterior, ou a realidade. Isso nada prova da realidade absoluta do universo porque existe a hipnose colectiva. Já vi um grande hipnotizador obrigar um grande número de pessoas ver, positivamente ver, a mesma hora falsa em relógios que o não estavam. Concluo de aqui a existência de um Hipnotizador supremo, a quem chamo Deus, porque consegue impor a sua sugestão à generalidade das almas, as quais, contudo, não sei se ele criou ou não criou, porque não sei o que é criar, mas que é possível que criasse, cada uma para si mesma, como o hipnotizador me pode sugerir que sou outra pessoa ou que sinto uma dor que eu não posso dizer que não sinto, pois que a sinto. Para mim ser «real» consiste em ser susceptível de ser experienciado por todas as almas; e isto obriga-me a acreditar num Hipnotizador Infinito, pois criou uma sugestão chamada universo capaz de ser experienciado por todas as almas, não só reais, mas até possíveis. À parte isto, sou engenheiro - isto é, não tenho moral, política ou religião independente da realidade real mensurável das coisas mensuráveis, e da realidade virtual das coisas imensuráveis. Também sou poeta, e tenho uma estética que existe por si mesma, sem ter que ver com a filosofia que tenho ou com a moral, a política ou a religião que sou ocasionalmente forçado a ter.\\nAntónio Mora, sim. Esse realmente, recebendo de Caeiro a mensagem na sua totalidade, se esforçou por traduzi-la em filosofia, esclarecendo, recompondo, reajustando, alterando aqui e ali. Não sei se a filosofia de António Mora será o que seria a de Caeiro, se o meu mestre a tivesse. Mas aceito que seria a filosofia de Caeiro, se ele a tivesse e não fosse poeta, para a não poder ter. Assim como da semente se evolve a planta, e a planta não é a semente magnificada, mas uma coisa inteiramente diferente em aspecto, assim do gérmen contido na totalidade da poesia de Caeiro saiu naturalmente o corpo diferente e complexo que constitui a filosofia de Mora. Vou deixar a exposição da filosofia de Mora para o trecho seguinte a este. Estou cansado de querer entender.\\n',\n",

Mais vale, pensaram eles, que se defendam, desde logo, as doutrinas antipáticas. Por mim, acho preferível defender, como algum dia farei, com a devida argumentação sociológica, que é mais legítimo que os políticos roubem e espoliem o povo, do que roubar e espoliar o povo chamando a essa atitude “governo popular”, “democracia”, “liberdade” e outras coisas assim.\\nO amor à verdade substitui, na mocidade de hoje, o amor à mentira, ainda que generosamente encarado, que caracterizava a mocidade de ontem e de antes de ontem. De nada serve servir a mentira, por generosidade que seja. O anarquismo, o socialismo, o democratismo — todo esse lixo de teorias simpáticas que se esquecem de que teorizam para a humanidade de carne-e-osso — foram divinizações da mentira. E foram essa coisa a que Carlyle chama a pior espécie da mentira — a mentira que se julga verdade. Não foram o erro, que é admissível. Foram a mentira inconsciente. Qualquer erra. Mas não todos mentem inconscientemente.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Uma das conversas mais interessantes, em que entrou o meu mestre Caeiro,\\n',\n",
       "  'text': \"\\nUma das conversas mais interessantes, em que entrou o meu mestre Caeiro, foi aquela, em Lisboa, em que estávamos todos os do grupo e por acaso de falar se discutiu o conceito de Realidade.\\nSe não me engano ao lembrar, essa parte da conversa começou por uma observação lateral do F[ernando] P[essoa] a qualquer coisa que se havia dito. A observação foi esta: «No conceito de Ser não cabem partes nem gradações; uma coisa é ou não é.»\\n«Não sei se será bem assim», objectei eu. «Há que analisar esse conceito de ser. Parece-me que eie é uma superstição metafísica, pelo menos até certo ponto...»\\n«Mas o conceito de Ser nem é susceptível de análise», respondeu o FP. «A sua indivisibilidade começa aí.»\\n«O conceito não será», repliquei, «mas o seu valor é.»\\nO FP respondeu: «Mas o que é o 'valor' de um conceito independentemente do próprio conceito? Um conceito, isto é, uma ideia abstracta não é susceptível de mais nem menos, e portanto não é susceptível de valor, que é sempre uma questão de mais ou menos. Pode haver valor no uso ou na aplicação, mas esse valor é do uso ou da aplicação e não do conceito em si mesmo.»\\nNisto interrompeu o meu mestre Caeiro, que estivera ouvindo muito com os olhos esta discussão transpontina. «Onde não pode haver mais nem menos não há nada.»\\n«Ora essa, porquê?» perguntou o F.\\n«Porque tudo quanto é real pode ser mais ou menos, e a não ser o que é real nada pode existir.»\\n«Dê um exemplo, ó Caeiro», disse eu.\\n«A chuva», respondeu o meu mestre. «A chuva é uma coisa real. Por isso pode chover mais e pode chover menos. Se v. me disser: 'esta chuva não pode ser mais e não pode ser menos’, eu responderei, 'então essa chuva não existe'. A não ser, é claro, que v. queira dizer a chuva tal como é nesse momento: essa realmente é a que é e se fosse mais ou menos era outra. Mas eu quero dizer outra coisa...»\\n«Está bem, compreendi perfeitamente», atalhei eu.\\nAntes que eu prosseguisse, para dizer não sei já o quê, o FP voltou-se para Caeiro: «Diga-me v. uma coisa» (e apontou com o cigarro): «como é que v. considera um sonho? Um sonho é real ou não?»\\n«Considero um sonho como considero uma sombra», respondeu Caeiro inesperadamente, com a sua costumada prontidão divina. «Uma sombra é real mas é menos real que uma pedra. Um sonho é real - senão não era sonho - mas é menos real que uma coisa. Ser real é ser assim.»\\nO FP tem a vantagem de viver mais nas ideias do que em si mesmo. Esqueceu-se não só de que estava argumentando, mas até da verdade ou falsidade do que ouvia: entusiasmaram-no as possibilidades metafísicas desta teoria súbita, […]\\n«Isso é uma ideia admirável! E é originalíssima! Nunca me tinha ocorrido» (E este «nunca me tinha ocorrido»?, tão ingenuamente sugeridor da natural impossibilidade de ocorrer a outrem qualquer coisa que não tivesse já ocorrido a ele, Fernando?)... «Nunca me tinha ocorrido que se pudesse considerar a realidade como susceptível de graus. Isso, de facto, equivale a considerar o Ser não como uma ideia propriamente abstracta mas como uma ideia numérica...»\\n«Isso é um bocado confuso para mim» hesitou Caeiro «mas parece-me que sim, que é isso. O que eu quero dizer é isto: ser real é haver outras coisas reais, porque não se pode ser real sozinho; e como ser real é ser uma coisa que não é essas outras coisas, é ser diferente delas; e como a realidade é uma coisa como o tamanho ou o peso - senão não havia realidade - e como todas as coisas são diferentes, não há coisas iguais em realidade como não há coisas iguais em tamanho e em peso. Há-de haver sempre uma diferença, embora seja muito pequena. Ser real é isto.»\\n«Isso ainda é mais curioso!» exclamou o FP. «V. então considera a realidade como um atributo das coisas; assim parece ser, visto que a compara ao tamanho e ao peso. Mas diga-me uma coisa: qual é a coisa de que a realidade é um atributo? O que é que está por trás da realidade?»\\n«Por trás da realidade?» repetiu o meu mestre Caeiro. «Por trás da realidade não está nada. Também por trás do tamanho não está nada, e por trás do peso não está nada.»\\n«Mas se uma coisa não tiver realidade não existe, e pode existir sem ter tamanho nem peso...»\\n«Não se for uma coisa que por natureza tenha tamanho e peso. Uma pedra não pode existir sem tamanho; uma pedra não pode existir sem peso. Mas uma pedra não é um tamanho e uma pedra não é um peso. Também uma pedra não pode existir sem realidade, mas a pedra não é uma realidade.»\\n«Está bem», respondeu o F., entre impaciente, apanhante de ídeias incertas, e fugir-lhe-o-chão. «Mas quando v. diz 'uma pedra tem realidade' v. distingue pedra de realidade.»\\n«Distingo: a pedra não é realidade, tem realidade. A pedra é só pedra.»\\n«E o que quer isso dizer?»\\n«Não sei: está ali. Uma pedra é uma pedra e tem que ter realidade para ser pedra. Uma pedra é uma pedra e tem que ter peso para ser pedra. Um homem não é uma cara mas tem que ter cara para ser homem. Eu não sei porque isto é assim, nem sei mesmo se há porquê para isto ou para qualquer coisa...»\\n«V. sabe, Caeiro», disse o F. reflectivamente: «v. está a elaborar uma filosofia um tanto ou quanto contrária ao que v. pensa e sente. V. está a fazer uma espécie de kantismo seu - criando uma pedra-noumenon, uma pedra-em-si. Eu explico, eu explico.. .» E passou a explicar a tese kantiana e como o que Caeiro dissera se conformava mais ou menos com ela. Depois indicou a diferença; ou o que, a seu ver, era a diferença: Para Kant esses atributos - peso, tamanho (não realidade) - são conceitos impostos à pedra-em-si pelos nossos sentidos, ou, melhor, pelo facto de que observamos. V. parece indicar que esses conceitos são tão coisas como a próspria pedra-em-si. Ora isso é que torna a sua teoria difícil de compreender, ao passo que a de Kant, verdadeira ou falsa, é perfeitamente compreensível.»\\nO meu mestre Caeiro ouvira isto com a maior atenção. Uma ou outra vez piscou os olhos como para sacudir ideias como sonos. E, depois de pensar um bocado, respondeu.\\n«Eu não tenho teorias. Eu não tenho filosofia. Eu vejo mas não sei nada. Chamo a uma pedra uma pedra para a distinguir de uma flor ou de uma árvore, enfim de tudo quanto não seja pedra. Ora cada pedra é diferente de outra pedra, mas não é por não ser pedra: é por ter outro tamanho e outro peso e outra forma e outra cor. E também por ser outra coisa. Chamo a uma pedra e a outra pedra ambas pedras porque são parecidas uma com a outra naquelas coisas que fazem a gente chamar pedra a uma pedra. Mas na verdade a gente devia dar a cada pedra um nome diferente e próprio, como se faz aos homens; isso não se faz porque seria impossível arranjar tanta palavra, mas não porque fosse erro...»\\nO FP atalhou: «Diga-me uma coisa, para esclarecer tudo: v. admite uma ‘pedreidade', por assim dizer, assim como admite um tamanho e um peso? Assim como v. diz esta pedra é maior - isto é, tem mais tamanho - que aquela, ou 'esta pedra tem mais peso que aquela', dirá v. também 'esta pedra é mais pedra do que aquela'? ou, em outras palavras, 'esta pedra tem mais pedreidade que aquela'?»\\n«Sim, senhor» respondeu logo o meu mestre. «Eu estou pronto a dizer, 'esta pedra é mais pedra que aquela'. E estou pronto a dizer isto se ela for maior que a outra, ou tiver mais peso, porque o tamanho e o peso são necessários a uma pedra para ela ser pedra... ou, principalmente, se ela tiver mais completamente que outra todos os atributos, como v. lhes chama, que uma pedra tem que ter para ser pedra.»\\n«E o que chama v. a uma pedra que v. vê em sonho?» e o F. sorriu.\\n«Chamo-lhe um sonho», disse o meu mestre Caeiro, «Chamo-lhe um sonho de uma pedra».\\n»Compreendo» e o F. acenou. «V[ocê] - como se diria filosoficamente - não distingue a substância dos atributos. Uma pedra é uma coisa composta de um certo número de atributos - os necessários para compor aquilo a que se chama uma pedra - e de uma certa quantidade de cada atributo, que é o que dá à pedra determinado tamanho, determinada dureza, determinado peso, determinada cor, que a distinguem de outra pedra, sendo contudo ambas elas pedras porque têm os mesmos atributos, embora em quantidade diferente. Ora isto equivale a negar a existência real da pedra: a pedra passa a ser simplesmente uma soma de coisas reais…» \\n\\n«Mas uma soma real! É a soma de um peso real e de um tamanho real e de uma cor real e assim por diante. E por isso é que a pedra, além do tamanho, do peso, etc., tem realidade também... Não tem realidade como pedra: tem realidade porque é uma soma de atributos, como v. lhes chama, todos \\n\\nreais. \\n\\nComo cada atributo tem realidade, a pedra tem-na também.»\\n\\n«Voltemos ao sonho», disse o F. «V. a uma pedra que vê em sonho chama um sonho, ou, quando muito, um sonho de uma pedra. Porque diz v. 'de uma pedra'? Porque emprega a palavra 'pedra'?»\\n«Pela mesma razão que v., quando vê o meu retrato, diz 'isto é o Caeiro' e não quer dizer que seja eu em carne e osso».\\nDesatámos todos a rir. «Compreendo e desisto», disse o Fernando a rir connosco. Les dieux sont ceux qui ne doutent jamais. Nunca compreendi tão bem a frase de Villiers de l'Isle Adam.\\nEsta conversa ficou-me gravada na alma; creio que a reproduzi com uma nitidez que não está longe de taquigráfica, salvo a taquigrafia. Tenho a memória intensa e clara que é um dos característicos de certos tipos de loucura. E esta conversa teve um grande resultado. Está claro que foi inconsequente como todas as conversas, e que seria fácil provar que, perante uma lógica rigorosa, só quem não falou se não contradisse. Nas afirmações e respostas, interessantes como sempre, do meu mestre Caeiro pode um espírito filosófico encontrar reflexos do que na verdade seriam sistemas diferentes. Mas, ao conceder isto, não creio nisto. Caeiro devia estar certo e ter razão, ainda nos pontos em que a não tivesse.\\nDe resto, esta conversa teve um grande resultado. Foi nela que o António Mora bebeu a inspiração para um dos capítulos mais assombrosos dos seus Prolegómenos - o capítulo sobre a ideia de Realidade. Em todo o decurso da conversa, foi o António Mora o único que não disse nada. Limitou-se a ouvir com os olhos parados para dentro as ideias que se tinham estado a dizer. As ideias do meu mestre Caeiro, expostas nesta conversa com o atabalhoamento intelectual do instinto, e, portanto de um modo forçosamente impreciso e contraditório, foram convertidas, nos Prolegómenos, num sistema coerente e lógico.\\nNão pretendo diminuir o valor realíssimo de António Mora. Mas, assim como a base de todo o seu sistema filosófico nasceu, segundo ele mesmo o diz com orgulho abstracto, da simples frase de Caeiro, «A Natureza é partes sem um todo», assim uma parte desse sistema - o maravilhoso conceito da Realidade como «dimensão», e o conceito derivado de «graus de realidade» - nasceu precisamente desta conversa. O seu a seu dono, e tudo ao meu mestre Caeiro.\\n\",\n",

A enorme concorrência comercial, a complicação de internacionalismos, a crescente necessitação de corpos de operários especialistas, que desenvolvem um orgulho rigidamente incompatível com a sua posição nas sociedades, e que, por serem operários, vão suscitar esse orgulho doentio em outros, de mais baixos misteres — tudo isto contribui para que se mantenha, íntegra e indesfeita, a decadência, já normal, da época. Conseguimos esse desiderato\\n\\n \\n\\nde alienado — a normalização da anormalidade. Obtivemos, com isso, a vantagem de tornar a vida mais agitadamente interessante a um bom número de pessoas que em uma sociedade bem ordenada, não existiriam, propriamente falando, individualmente. Mas essa vantagem individual, e por isso transitória, pagamo-la com a fixação, paralela, da incapacidade de criar, com a normalização, conexa, da impotência de grandes ideias, a inapetência para grandes fins.\\n\\nNós realizamos, modernamente, o sentido preciso daquela frase de Voltaire, onde diz que, se os mundos são habitados, a terra é o manicómio do Universo Somos, com efeito, um manicómio, quer sejam ou não habitados os outros planetas.

Quero que sejamos indiferentes para com uma época que nada pode querer de nós, e sobre a qual em nada podemos agir. Mas não quero que se cante essa indiferença como coisa boa de per si. É isso que faz Ricardo Reis. Por esse ponto, longe de tornar-se indiferente às correntes da época, integra-se em uma delas, que é a decadente. Essa indiferença, é já uma adaptação ao meio.

Desorientou-me, segundo, que não só o fizesse com alegria, mas que transmitisse essa alegria aos outros. Quando estou muito triste, leio Caeiro e é uma brisa. Fico logo calmo, cantante e com fé - sim, fico com fé em Deus, na alma, na pequenez transcendente da vida depois de ler os poemas deste ateu de Deus e do homem sem além na própria terra.\\nE porquê? Porque a personalidade que está por trás da obra, a vitaliza com outra coisa que não é as ideias que lá estão, e por onde ela aparentemente se manifesta. É o poeta Caeiro, não o filósofo Caeiro, que nos ama. O que realmente recebemos daqueles versos é a sensação infantil da vida, com toda a materialidade directa dos conceitos da infância, e toda a espiritualidade vital da esperança e do crescimento, que são do inconsciente, da alma e corpo, da infância. Aquela obra é uma madrugada que nos ergue e anima; e a madrugada, contudo, é mais que material, mais que anti-espiritual, porque é um efeito abstracto, puro vácuo, nada.\\nA obra de Caeiro tem, porém, e além disto, um efeito crítico. Estes versos da sensação directa, contraposta a sua alma aos nossos conceitos sem naturalidade, à nossa civilização mental, artificiosa, contabilizada em gavetas, rasga-nos todos os trapos que temos por fato, lava-nos a cara da química e o estômago dos farmacêuticos - entra pela nossa casa dentro e mostra-nos que uma mesa de madeira é madeira, madeira, madeira, e que mesa é uma alucinação necessária da nossa vontade que fabrica mesas.\\nFeliz de quem, um momento que fosse na vida, conseguir ver a mesa como madeira, sentir a mesa como madeira - ver a madeira da mesa sem ver a mesa. Volte depois a «saber» que é mesa, mas toda a vida não esquecerá que ela é madeira. E amará a mesa, mesa como mesa, melhor.\\nFoi este o efeito de Caeiro sobre mim. Não deixei de ver a aparência das coisas, a sua integridade divina e humana, mas fiquei vendo-as, ao mesmo tempo, na alma material da sua matéria. Fiquei liberto. De então em diante eu era como um daqueles Rosa-Cruz, de quem reza a lenda ou a verdade, que, semelhantes por fora a todos os humanos, e conformes com os costumes e maneiras do mundo igualitário, têm consigo o segredo do Universo e sabem sempre onde está «a porta da fuga» e a magia da essenciação.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nÉ muito curiosa a complexidade da simplicidade de Caeiro. É também muito curiosa a evolução do seu conceito do universo, ou, melhor, da falta de universo. Sendo absolutamente um sensacionista, as suas sensações são inteligências, com um raciocínio próprio, com um poder crítico próprio. Começando como uma espécie de S. Francisco de Assis sem fé, foi-se arrastando lentamente, aos rasgões nos obstáculos, através da brenha do que tinha aprendido - felizmente muito pouco. Finalmente, apareceu nu. Foi a culminância de «O Guardador de Rebanhos», dos poemas - tão novos na superfície da função mais antiga no mundo! - de «O Pastor Amoroso» e dos poemas não-anómalos dos «Inconjuntos». Esses poemas anómalos são já a invasão da verdade pela morte. Há alguns em que a visão como se perturba. O homem nu está experimentando a mortalha. Mas, por fim, e vendo a obra em conjunto, ela é o nu substantivo, porque o fato o cobria mal e o que a mortalha cobre é nada.\\nO seu comentário a S. Francisco de Assis dá tudo. Li-lhe uma vez, traduzindo rapidamente, parte das «Florinhas». Não li mais porque ele, indignado ou quasi, me interrompeu com incómodo próprio. «É bom homem, mas está bêbado», disse o meu mestre Caeiro. Pareceu-me isto, no repente, um impulso sem expressão apropriada; mas, logo a seguir, reparei na deliquescência de enternecimento do Santo, na candura da sua alma por trás desse e reconheci a fotografia.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\n«Nunca altero o que escrevi», disse-me uma vez o meu mestre Caeiro. «Se o escrevi assim é porque o senti assim, e nada tem para o caso que eu hoje sinta de um modo diferente. Os meus poemas contradizem-se muitas vezes, bem sei, mas que importa, se eu me não contradigo? Há coisas nalguns dos meus poemas, sabe?, que eu não seria capaz de escrever agora, em ocasião nenhuma. Mas escrevi-as então, e essa é que foi a ocasião em que as escrevi. Por isso ficam como estão.»\\nE, a meu pedido, exemplificou:\\n«Olhe, por exemplo, várias coisas no poema sobre o Menino Jesus. Eu hoje era incapaz, nem por distração, de dizer que «a direcção do meu olhar é o dedo dele apontando». Eu era incapaz de dizer que «ele brinca com os meus sonhos» e vira uns de pernas para o ar, e põe uns em cima dos outros, e outras coisas assim. Enfim, eu era incapaz de escrever o poema hoje, e afinal isso é que quer dizer tudo.»\\nDefendi o poema, e as próprias frases que Caeiro nele incriminava.\\n«Não, não têm defesa. São absolutamente falsas. A direcção de um olhar não é um dedo: é a direcção de um olhar. Não se brinca com sonhos como se fossem pedras ou caixas de fósforos vazias. E tudo aquilo mesmo não é nada. Foi uma distracção minha e eu também existo nas minhas distracções, embora distraidamente.\\n«Lembro-me perfeitamente de como escrevi esse poema. O Padre B... tinha estado lá em casa a falar com a minha tia e esteve a dizer tantas coisas que me irritaram que eu escrevi o poema para respirar. Por isso é que ele está fora da minha respiração vulgar. Mas o estado de irritação é um estado falso em mim; por isso o poema não está inteiramente certo comigo, mas só com a minha irritação e com a pessoa a mais que a irritação é quando a gente a tem.\\n«Hoje, se estivesse irritado - o que já é muito difícil de acontecer - eu não escreveria coisa nenhuma. Deixava a irritação irritar-se. Depois, quando sentisse vontade de escrever, escrevia. Deixava o escrever escrever-se.\\n«Ainda hoje, de vez em quando, escrevo um ou outro poema com que não concordo; mas escrevo-o. Assim como acho interessante toda a gente por não ser eu, acho às vezes interessante um ou outro momento em que não sou eu. Em todo o caso, já hoje me não é possível afastar-me tanto do que quero como no poema sobre o Menino Jesus. Posso afastar-me de mim, mas já não me afasto da Realidade.»\\nDurante uns momentos, Caeiro esteve silencioso. Depois acrescentou:\\n«O poema de agora em que me afastei mais de mim é aquele que escrevi o mês passado, depois daquela conversa entre o Ricardo Reis e o António Mora sobre o paganismo e os deuses.» (Referia-se ao poema (...) dos Inconjuntos)\\n«Ouvi-os, e pus-me a imaginar como é que se imaginava uma religião. E lembrou-me que deveria ser assim. Por isso escrevi o poema, não como acto poético mas como acto de imaginação... Sim, como se estivesse contando um conto a uma criança. Tinha que pôr lá o Príncipe... Eu também posso fazer contos de fadas - mas só uma vez, é claro...»\\n«Há um outro poema seu», disse eu, «que está um pouco nessas condições.» E, como Caeiro olhasse a pergunta, «É aquele em que v., falando de um homem numa casa iluminada, à distância, diz, quando deixa de ver o homem, que ele deixou de ser real». (Trata-se, como é de ver, do poema (...) dos Inconjuntos).\\n«Eu não digo que ele deixou de ser real: digo que ele deixou de ser real para mim. Não quero dizer que ele deixasse de ser visível para quem esteja onde o veja. «Deixou de ser visível para mim. Pode até ter morrido.»\\n«V. admite, então, duas formas de realidade?»\\n«Muito mais do que duas», respondeu inesperadamente o meu mestre Caeiro.\\n«V. bem vê... Aquela cadeira é madeira e aquela cadeira é madeira, e aquela cadeira é a substância de que a madeira é feita, e que não sei o que é na química, e aquela cadeira é talvez - é com certeza - muitas outras coisas mais. Mas é-as todas. Se a vejo é principalmente cadeira; se a toco é principalmente madeira; se a mordesse e tomasse o sabor da madeira, ela seria principalmente a composição da madeira. São como o lado direito e o esquerdo, e a frente e as costas de qualquer coisa. Todos os lados são reais, cada um do seu lado. O homem que eu deixei de ver seria real, mas era de outro lado; como eu não estava desse lado, deixou de ser real para mim.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nIconoclasta\\n\\nREPÚBLICA E RELIGIÃO\\n\\n\\nNeste ponto, mais do que em nenhum outro, precisa a democracia portuguesa que lhe apontem o verdadeiro caminho.\\n\\n\\nO argumento (de V. de Vilhena, [...], etc.) não vale nada. \\n\\nÀ mão \\n\\nestá a Igreja logo que esteja sob as leis do país, como deve estar tudo quanto nesse país existe; nem mais é justo, nem mais é preciso.\\n\\n\\nA propaganda anticlerical tem, no nosso país, tido uma orientação péssima. Tem sido quase tão má como a propaganda anti-clerical francesa, com a agravante, que a francesa não tem, de ser em métodos e (...) estrangeira, tirada da França, no nosso caso. Ora nós somos portugueses, que não franceses. O vago misticismo que nos caracteriza — e que é de todo ausente do espírito francês — não pode ser desdenhado, com risco de preparar uma reacção tremenda. Incutir positivismo à alma portuguesa é esforçar-se por matá-la. O português pode não ter necessidade de crer, mas tem, sempre, de divagar e sonhar.\\nEstas questões de psicologia são mais importantes do que a muita gente — aliás estúpida dentro de concebíveis limites — parece.\\n\\nConta-se entre os nossos propagandistas anti-religiosos gente que não soube distinguir entre uma teoria e uma lei, entre um facto científico e um sistema de metafísica baseado sobre dados da ciência. Basta-lhes ou que um facto seja afirmado por um homem de ciência para que seja crível; e se se dá o caso de esse facto vir de encontro às crenças religiosas, põe as mãos no fogo pela verdade dele. Assim temos idiotas que ignoram que Os \\n\\nEnigmas \\n\\ndo \\n\\nUniverso \\n\\nde Haeckel é\\n\\n \\n\\numa obra em grande parte de metafísica. Temos desgraçados que afirmam que a c[iência] nega ou desprova a imortalidade da alma, quando o facto evidente é que não há ciência nenhuma sob cuja alçada esteja esse problema, nem que tenha elementos para sequer conceber possível a sua solução. O problema da imortalidade da alma é puramente metafísico; nada tem com a c[iência]. Quem quiser crer na imortalidade da alma pode fazê-lo, que nenhuma ciência lhe pode dizer nada. (Tão idiota é Haeckel ao querer provar a mortalidade da alma, como (...) ao querer responder-lhe nos mesmos termos — idiotas porque julgam fazer ciência, quando é metafísica que fazem.)\\n\\nQuais devem ser as relações entre o Estado o a Igreja, em uma democracia?\\nVejamos primeiro — tão rapidamente quanto for possível à necessidade de clareza — em que basicamente difere o espírito republicano do espírito monárquico; porque — e este ponto parece ser quase desconhecido, e não só em Portugal — não há sociologicamente mon[arquia] e rep[ública]; mas espírito monárquico e espírito republicano, o que é importantemente diferente.\\n',\n",

Com a alma atormentada pela impotência do ódio que nos nascera da contemplação dessa horrorosa maioria traidora que ora no parlamento é para o rigoroso sociólogo apta e completamente representativa da monarquia portuguesa, lucubrávamos com impaciência o esboço mental de um artigo, onde, a par da frase enraivecida e áspera, a psicologia explicativa não fizesse falta. Servir-nos-ia de tema para esse artigo a figura porcamente representativa do Sr. José Luciano de Castro, bandalho máximo da política portuguesa. Pouco mais houvéramos obtido, porém, do que a intuição daquele epíteto, e a correspondente compreensão psicológica do que de adaptado era ao indivíduo a quem o aplicaríamos, quando, por um acaso que sentimos não poder considerar obra da Providência, nos veio ter às mãos um panfleto partidário que num catálogo se designaria do modo seguinte: \"A ... transcribe).\\nOs panfletos partidários têm geralmente valor, seja qual for a circunstância de momento e de carácter em que foram escritos, quando sejam escritos da oposição.

Aquele panfleto, cujo autor não sabemos, nem, realmente, nos importa saber, basta-nos como ponto de partida fácil para as deduções de natureza sociológica e sociologicamente psicológica que nos propúnhamos fazer neste artigo.

       "  'text': '\\nAS NOSSAS ENTREVISTAS\\n\\nO escritor Fernando Pessoa expõe-nos as suas ideias sobre os vários  aspectos da arte e da literatura portuguesas.\\n\\nEntrevistar Fernando Pessoa não é fácil. Só é fácil entrevistar os que não pensam, os que não se importam de jogar palavras, ao acaso, atirando-as impudicamente ao vento.\\nFernando Pessoa, quer como Fernando Pessoa, quer como Álvaro de Campos - o engenheiro alucinado que comporta o seu segundo eu, e que aparece em toda a parte, enchendo a voz de louvores e raios para a Vida - raios partam a Vida e quem lá ande! -é sempre um voluptuoso do raciocínio, um amante da inteligência, podemos dizer: um criador duma nova Razão. Paradoxal? Sem dúvida. Mas há tantas maneiras de ser paradoxal!\\nA entrevista que se segue, toda escrita por Fernando Pessoa - nem podia deixar de ser, visto Fernando Pessoa possuir uma sintaxe própria para a lógica própria dos seus pensamentos, misto de seriedade e de ironia, vai decerto prender o espírito dos leitores...\\nAtenção! Fernando Pessoa vai responder às perguntas que lhe fizemos:\\n- Que pensa da nossa crise? Dos seus aspectos - político, moral e intelectual?\\n- A nossa crise provém, essencialmente, do excesso de civilização dos incivilizáveis. Esta frase, como todas que envolvem uma contradição, não envolve contradição nenhuma. Eu explico.\\nTodo povo se compõe de uma aristocracia e de ele mesmo. Como o povo é um, esta aristocracia e este ele mesmo têm uma substância idêntica; manifestam-se, porém, diferentemente A aristocracia manifesta-se como indivíduos, incluindo alguns indivíduos amadores; o povo revela-se como todo ele um indivíduo só. Só colectivamente é que o povo não é colectivo.\\nO povo português é, essencialmente, cosmopolita. Nunca um verdadeiro português foi português: foi sempre tudo. Ora ser tudo em um indivíduo é ser tudo; ser tudo em uma colectividade é cada um dos indivíduos não ser nada. Quando a atmosfera da civilização é cosmopolita, como na Renascença, o português pode ser português, pode portanto ser indivíduo, pode portanto ter aristocracia. Quando a atmosfera da civilização não é cosmopolita - como no tempo entre o fim da Renascença e o princípio, em que estamos, de uma Renascença nova - o português deixa de poder respirar individualmente. Passa a ser só portugueses. Passa a não poder ter aristocracia. Passa a não passar. (Garanto-lhe que estas frases têm uma matemática íntima.)\\nOra um povo sem aristocracia não pode ser civilizado. A civilização, porém, não perdoa. Por isso esse povo civiliza-se com o que pode arranjar, que é o seu conjunto. E como o seu conjunto é individualmente nada, passa a ser tradicionalista e a imitar o estrangeiro, que são as duas maneiras de não ser nada. É claro que o português, com a sua tendência para ser tudo, forçosamente havia de ser nada de todas as maneiras possíveis. Foi neste vácuo de si próprio que o português abusou de civilizar-se. Está nisto, como lhe disse, a essência da nossa crise.\\nAs nossas crises particulares procedem desta crise geral. A nossa crise política é o sermos governados por uma maioria que não há. A nossa crise moral é que desde 1580 - fim da Renascença em nós e de nós na Renascença - deixou de haver indivíduos em Portugal para haver só portugueses. Por isso mesmo acabaram os portugueses nessa ocasião. Foi então que começou o português à antiga portuguesa, que é mais moderno que o português, e é o resultado de estarem interrompidos os portugueses. A nossa crise intelectual é simplesmente o não termos consciência disto.\\nRespondi, creio, à sua pergunta. Se V. reparar bem para o que lhe disse, verá que tem um sentido. Qual, não me compete a mim dizer.\\n- Que pensa dos nossos escritores do momento, prosadores poetas e dramaturgos?\\n- Citar é ser injusto. Enumerar é esquecer. Não quero esquecer ninguém de quem me não lembre. Confio ao silêncio a injustiça. A ânsia de ser completo leva ao desespero de o não poder ser. Não citarei ninguém. Julgue-se citado, quem se julgue com direito a sê-lo. Resolvo assim todos. Lavo as mãos, como Pilatos; lavo-as, porém, inutilmente, porque é sempre inutilmente que se faz um gesto simplificador. Que sei eu do presente, salvo que ele é já o futuro? Quem são os meus contemporâneos? Só o futuro o poderá dizer. Coexiste comigo muita gente que vive comigo apenas porque dura comigo. Esses são apenas os meus conterrâneos no tempo; e eu não quero ser bairrista em matéria de imortalidade. Na dúvida, repito, não citarei ninguém.\\n- Estaremos em face de uma renascença espiritual?\\n- Estamos tão desnacionalizados que devemos estar renascendo. Para os outros povos, na sua totalidade eles próprios, o desnacionalizar-se é o perder-se. Para nós, que não somos nacionais, o desnacionalizar-se é o encontrar-se. Apesar dos grandes obstáculos à nossa regeneração - todas as doutrinas de regeneração - estamos no início de tornar a começar a existir. Chegámos ao ponto em que colectivamente estamos fartos de tudo e individualmente fartos de estar fartos. Extraviámo-nos a tal ponto que devemos estar no bom caminho. Os sinais do nosso ressurgimento próximo estão patentes para os que não vêem o visível. São o caminho-de-ferro de Antero a Pascoaes e a nova linha que está quase construída. Falo em termos de vida metálica porque a época renasce nestes termos. O símbolo, porém, nasceu antes dos engenheiros.\\nNada há a esperar, é certo, das classes dirigentes, porque não são dirigentes; e ainda menos da proletariagem, porque ser inferior não é uma superioridade. Com razão lhes chamei eu, a estes, subgente, num artigo da antiga Águia - da Águia que voava. Só a burguesia, que é a ausência da classe social, pode criar o futuro. Só de uma classe que não há pode nascer uma classe que não há ainda. Seja como for, avancemos confiadamente. Todos os caminhos vão dar à ponte quando o rio não tem nenhuma.\\n- O que se deve entender por arte portuguesa? Concorda com este termo? Há arte verdadeiramente portuguesa?\\n- Por arte portuguesa deve entender-se uma arte de Portugal que nada tenha de português, por nem sequer imitar o estrangeiro. Ser português, no sentido decente da palavra, é ser europeu sem a má-criação de nacionalidade. Arte portuguesa será aquela em que a Europa - entendendo por Europa principalmente a Grécia antiga e o universo inteiro - se mire e se reconheça sem se lembrar do espelho. Só duas nações - a Grécia passada e Portugal futuro - receberam dos deuses a concessão de serem não só elas mas também todas as outras. Chamo a sua atenção para o facto, mais importante que geográfico, de que Lisboa e Atenas estão quase na mesma latitude.\\n- O regionalismo na literatura e na pintura?\\n- O regionalismo é uma degeneração gordurosa do nacionalismo, e o nacionalismo também. E como o nacionalismo é antiportuguês (sendo bom, cá no Sul, só para os povos latinos e ibéricos), o regionalismo em Portugal é uma doença do que não há. Amar a nossa terra não é gostar do nosso quintal. E isto de quintal também tem interpretações. O meu quintal em Lisboa está ao mesmo tempo em Lisboa, em Portugal e na Europa. O bom regionalismo é amá-lo por ele estar na Europa. Mas quando chego a este regionalismo, sou já português, e já não penso no meu quintal. (O facto de o meu quintal ser inteiramente metafórico não diminui a verdade de tudo isto: Deus, e o próprio universo, são metáforas também.)\\n- Teriam existido em toda a nossa história literária períodos de criação?\\n- O nosso único período de criação foi dedicado a criar um mundo. Não tivemos tempo para pensar nisso. O próprio Camões não foi mais que o que esqueceu fazer. Os Lusíadas é grande, mas nunca se escreveu a valer. Literariamente, o passado de Portugal está no futuro. O Infante, Albuquerque e os outros semideuses da nossa glória esperam ainda o seu cantor. Este poderá não falar deles; basta que os valha em seu canto, e falará deles. Camões estava muito perto para poder sonhá-los. Nas faldas do Himalaia o Himalaia é só as faldas do Himalaia. É na distância, ou na memória, ou na imaginação que o Himalaia é da sua altura, ou talvez um pouco mais alto. Há só um período de criação na nossa história literária: não chegou ainda.\\n- Continuará sendo o lirismo a nossa feição literária predominante?\\n- Há duas feições literárias -a épica e a dramática. O lirismo é a incapacidade comovida de ter qualquer delas. O que é ser lírico? É cantar as emoções que se têm. Ora cantar as emoções que se têm faz-se até sem cantar. O que custa é cantar as emoções que se não têm. Sentir profundamente o que se não sente é a flâmula de almirante da inspiração. O poeta dramático faz isto directamente; o poeta épico fá-lo indirectamente, sentindo o conjunto da obra mais que as partes dela, isto é, sentindo exactamente aquele elemento da obra de que não pode haver emoção nenhuma pessoal, porque é abstracto e por isso impessoal. Fomos esboçadamente épicos. Seremos inviolavelmente dramáticos. Fomos líricos quando não fomos nada. O lirismo só continuará sendo a nossa feição predominante se não formos capazes de ter feição predominante.\\n- O que calcula que seja o futuro da raça portuguesa?\\n-O Quinto Império. O futuro de Portugal —que não calculo mas sei —está escrito já, para quem saiba lê-lo, nas trovas do Bandarra, e também nas quadras de Nostradamo. Esse futuro é sermos tudo. Quem, que seja português, pode viver a estreiteza de uma só personalidade, de uma só nação, de uma só fé? Que português verdadeiro pode, por exemplo, viver a estreiteza estéril do catolicismo, quando fora dele há que viver todos os protestantismos, todos os credos orientais, todos os paganismos mortos e vivos, fundindo-os portuguesmente no Paganismo Superior? Não queiramos que fora de nós fique um único deus! Absorvamos os deuses todos! Conquistámos já o Mar: resta que conquistemos o Céu, ficando a terra para os Outros, os eternamente Outros, os Outros de nascença, os europeus que não são europeus porque não são portugueses. Ser tudo, de todas as maneiras, porque a verdade não pode estar em faltar ainda alguma coisa! Criemos assim o Paganismo Superior, o Politeismo Supremo! Na eterna mentira de todos os deuses, só os deuses todos são verdade.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nPORTUGAL, VASTO IMPÉRIO - Um inquérito nacional\\n\\n\\n\\nI \\n-\\n Sim ou não Portugal, potência de primeira grandeza na Renascença guarda em si a vitalidade necessária para manter no futuro, na nova Renascença que há-de seguir-se à Idade Média que atravessamos, o lugar de uma grande potência.\\n\\n\\nCumpre, antes de mais nada, definir a expressão “grande potência”. Por “grande potência” se deve entender, evidentemente, uma nação que influi notavelmente na vida ou nos destinos da civilização. Podemos, porém, distinguir três maneiras de assim influir notavelmente. Distinguiremos, portanto, três espécies de “grande potência”.\\nInfluir é transformar . Há três maneiras de transformar: transformar para menos, ou desagregar; transformar para mais, ou desenvolver; transformar para outro, ou construir. Força é, pois, que as grandes potências se manifestem tais, ou pela desagregação que produzem, ou pelo desenvolvimento que promovem, ou pela construção que estabelecem, ou novidade que originam.\\nDuas são as forças da desagregação - a decadência e a violência externa. A decadência é intransmissível: pode ser estimulada, porém não imposta; são portanto seus estímulos, que não ela mesma, que comportam transmissão. A violência externa, pelo contrário, é imposição por natureza. Uma grande potência de desagregação significa portanto uma grande potência de violência, ou seja uma grande potência guerreira. É este o sentido em que ordinariamente se toma a expressão “grande potência”: é que a violência, como é a força visível, representa para o comum dos homens o modo único da força.\\nDuas são também as forças de desenvolvimento - o estímulo físico ou material e o estímulo intelectual ou moral. Na vida das sociedades, o primeiro é dado pelo comércio, o segundo pela cultura. Com efeito, o desenvolvimento dos povos se efectua, no que material, pela multiplicação de contactos económicos; no que mental, pela multiplicação de contactos culturais. E o comércio e a cultura andam comummente a par: é que a multiplicação de relações de uma espécie facilita inevitavelmente a multiplicação de relações da outra espécie. Há, pois, duas espécies de “grandes potências” expansivas da vida alheia: as potências primordialmente económicas, como a Alemanha e os Estados Unidos, e as potências culturais, como antigamente a Itália e subsequentemente a França.\\nQualquer transformação pode ser definida como sendo “para outro”, porém a transformação construtiva merece esse nome distintivamente. Na transformação para mais ou para menos a coisa transformada mantém os seus característicos essenciais; a transformação é quantitativa. Na transformação para outro a mudança é qualitativa. Que característicos adquire, porém, a coisa transformada, ao ser transformada “para outro”? Os do elemento transformador, pois outros não há que possivelmente adquira. Segue, pois, que a transformação construtiva implica uma conversão da substância da coisa transformada na substância da coisa transformadora. À nação que exerce esta espécie de influências, que é uma “grande potência” nesta função, chama-se com justeza, não grande potência, senão Império. Até hoje, adentro da civilização que vivemos, tem havido quatro impérios - o grego, o romano, o cristão, e o inglês (que não o britânico, que é império em outro, e mais baixo, sentido). Com sua prodigiosa visão, histórica como profética, distingue sempre Nostradamo entre o que chama simplesmente empire (que é qualquer dos grandes domínios fugazes com que se orna a história) e grand empire, que é o Império no sentido em que aqui usamos o termo.\\nSem dúvida que as três formas de ser grande potência se não excluem entre si; antes a duas, e a mais que duas, as pode reunir uma só nação.\\nPostos estes princípios, pergunta-se: para que forma de grande potência tem Portugal condições, se as tem para alguma?\\nPortugal, grande potência guerreira, ou desagregadora, é invisionável, o que não quer dizer que seja impossível, pois não podemos prever que alianças ou combinações poderão surgir do abismo do futuro. A pergunta, porém, refere-se às condições que Portugal tem, que não àquelas que poderá um dia vir a ter; e por “condições que tem” se entendem aquelas que ou estão hoje claramente latentes nele, ou em qualquer forma ou esboço nele se revelaram no passado. Ora pondo de parte, por irrisório neste respeito, o que somos hoje, o facto é que nunca tivemos condições ou propensão para a forma guerreira de grande potência. Nem para tal nos dispunha a nossa situação terrestre de nação pequena e excêntrica em continente e península, nem, em prova disso, nos empenhámos nunca com vantagem em guerras puramente agressivas, excepto as que precederam inevitavelmente do nosso mester orgânico de descobridores E estas viveram na atmosfera triunfal do fenómeno que lhes deu origem.\\nPortugal grande potência económica é talvez ainda mais invisionável que Portugal grande potência guerreira. Uma potência guerreira forma-se e desenvolve-se com mais facilidade e rapidez que uma potência económica, pois procede de instintos e forças mais primitivos do que esta. E se de potência guerreira não temos tradição senão por assim dizer corolária, de potência económica não temos tradição nenhuma, ou a temos negativa. Ainda, pois, que uma expansão ou federação futura nos convertesse em grande nação - sem o que se não pode ser uma grande potência económica -, nossa acção nesse campo seria sempre limitada pela de núcleos não só quantitativamente superiores ao nosso, mas ainda preparados tradicionalmente para o exercício dessa espécie de influência.\\nPortugal grande potência cultural é uma hipótese já de outro género. O exercício da grande influência guerreira ou económica implica a existência de uma nação grande, unida, disciplinada, o da grande influência cultural dispensa estes característicos. Exerceu-a a Itália quando nem sequer era nação, senão uma justaposição de pequenos estados, em conflito perpétuo uns com os outros, e cada um em quase constante desordem interna. Nem a nossa condição actual é, pois, obstáculo neste respeito; é-o, porém, a nossa carência quase absoluta de tradição cultural, propriamente dita. Quantitativamente, nunca a tivemos; qualitativamente, pouco. No fim da chamada Idade Média, e no princípio da Renascença, esboçámos, é certo, um acentuado movimento cultural, que abrange os Cancioneiros, os Romances de Cavalaria, e um ou outro fenómenos como a especulação de Francisco Sanches, aliás formado em outro ambiente; mas em breve o vinco, muito mais tipicamente nacional, das descobertas, arrastava para si toda a vitalidade portuguesa, e o catolicismo, então em período de reacção, se encarregou de anular aquela liberdade de especulação, sem a qual a cultura é impossível. Ficámos no estado vil de inteligência, servil e mimético, em que desde esse tempo temos vegetado. Se, porém, a necessidade cultural fosse, por qualquer razão, em nós orgânica, teria havido dela sinais, sobretudo desde que entrámos, com o mimetismo já citado, em regime liberal e depois em República. Mas o que tem havido é menos que pouco, a nossa indisposição cultural permanece evidente\\nPortugal grande potência construtiva, Portugal Império - aqui, sim, é que, através de grandeza e de decadência, se revela o nosso instinto, e se mantém a nossa tradição. Somos, por índole uma nação criadora e imperial. Com as Descobertas, e o estabelecimento do Imperialismo Ultramarino, criámos o mundo moderno - criação absoluta, tanto quanto socialmente isso é possível, que não simples elaboração ou renovação de criações alheias. Nas mais negras horas da nossa decadência, prosseguiu, sobretudo no Brasil, a nossa acção imperial, pela colonização; e foi nessas mesmas horas que em nós nasceu o sonho sebastianista, em que a ideia do Império Português atinge o estado religioso.\\nPortugal tem pois condições orgânicas para ser uma grande potência construtiva ou criadora, um Império. Uma coisa, porém, é dizer-se que Portugal tem condições para sê-lo; outra é predizer que o será. A pergunta não exige esta segunda demonstração, que, aliás, por extensa não poderia ser aqui dada. Nem há mester que se diga, também, em que consistirá presumivelmente essa criação portuguesa, qual será o sentido e o conteúdo desse Quinto Império. Fora preciso um livro inteiro para o dizer, nem chegou ainda a hora de dizer-se.\\n\\nII - Sim ou não Portugal, sendo a terceira potência colonial tem todos os direitos a ser considerada uma grande potência europeia?\\n\\nComo Portugal, grande potência, está no futuro - ou, se se preferir, só pode estar no futuro -, não pode exigir ao presente que o considere por aquilo que ele ainda não é, nem se sabe ao certo se será. Mas, como é a terceira potência colonial, pode e deve exigir que o tratem como a terceira potência colonial.\\n\\nIII - Sim ou não Portugal, amputado das suas colónias, perderá toda a razão de ser como povo independente no comércio europeu?\\n\\nPara o destino que presumo que será o de Portugal, as colónias não são precisas. A perda delas, porém, também não é precisa para esse destino. E, por certo, sem colónias, ficaria Portugal diminuído ante o mundo e perante si mesmo, material como moralmente. As colónias, portanto, não sendo uma necessidade, são contudo uma vantagem.\\n\\nIV - Sim ou não o moral da Nação pode ser levantado por uma intensa propaganda, pelo jornal, pela revista e pelo livro, de forma a criar uma mentalidade colectiva capaz de impor aos políticos uma política de grandeza nacional?\\n\\nNa hipótese afirmativa, qual o caminho a seguir?\\n\\n\\nHá só uma espécie de propaganda com que se pode levantar o moral de uma nação — a construção ou renovação e a difusão consequente e multímoda de um grande mito nacional. De instinto, a humanidade odeia a verdade, porque sabe, com o mesmo instinto, que não há verdade, ou que a verdade é inatingível. O mundo conduz-se por mentiras; quem quiser despertá-lo ou conduzi-lo terá que mentir-lhe delirantemente, e fá-lo-á com tanto mais êxito quanto mais mentir a si mesmo e se compenetrar da verdade da mentira que criou. Temos, felizmente, o mito sebastianista, com raízes profundas no passado e na alma portuguesa. Nosso trabalho é pois mais fácil; não temos que criar um mito, senão que renová-lo. Comecemos por nos embebedar desse sonho, por o integrar em nós, por o encarnar. Feito isso, cada um de nós independentemente e a sós consigo, o sonho se derramará sem esforço em tudo que dissermos ou escrevermos, e a atmosfera estará criada, em que todos os outros, como nós, o respirem. Então se dará na alma da Nação o fenómeno imprevisível de onde nascerão as Novas Descobertas, a Criação do Mundo Novo, o Quinto Império. Terá regressado El-Rei D. Sebastião.\\n',\n",

The rain fell like a sick affrightOf Nature at her work in killing him.Memory of what he was gave no delight,Delight at what he was was dead and dim.\\xa0O hands that once had clasped Hadrian's warm hands,Whose cold now found them cold!O hair bound erstwhile with the pressing bands!O eyes half-diffidently bold!O bare female male-body suchAs a god's likeness to humanity!O lips whose opening redness erst could touchLust's seats with a live art's variety!O fingers skilled in things not to be told!O tongue which, counter-tongued, made the blood bold!\\xa0O complete regency of lust throned onRaged consciousness's spilled suspension!These things are things that now must be no more.The rain is silent, and the EmperorSinks by te couch. His grief is like a rage,For the gods take away the life they giveAnd spoil te beauty they made live.He weeps and knows that every future ageIs looking on him out of the to-be;His love is on a universal stage;A thousand unborn eyes weep with his misery.\\xa0Antinous is dead, is dead for ever,Is dead for ever and all loves lament.Venus herself, that was Adonis' lover,Seeing him, that newly lived, now dead again,Lends her old grief's renewal to be blentWith Hadrian's pain.\\xa0Now is Apollo sad because te stealerOf his white body is for ever cold.No careful kisses on that nippled pointCovering his heart-beats' silent place restoreHis life again to ope his eyes and feel herPresence along his veins Love's fortress hold.No warmth of his another's warmth demands.Now will his hands behind his head no moreLinked, in that posture giving all but hands,On the projected body hands implore.\\xa0The rain falls, and he lies like one who hathForgotten all the gestures of his loveAnd lies awake waiting their hot return.But all his arts and toys are now with Death.This human ice no way of heat can move;These ashes of a fire no flame can burn.\\xa0O Hadrian, what will now thy cold life be?What boots it to be lord of men and might?His absence o' er thy visible emperyComes like a night,Nor is there morn in hopes of new delight.Now are thy nights widowed of love and kisses;Now are thy days robbed of the night's awaiting;Now have thy lips no purpose for thy blisses,Left but to speak the name that Death is matingWith solitude and sorrow and affright.\\xa0Thy vague hands grope, as if they had dropped joy.To hear that the rain ceases lift thy head,And thy raised glance take to the lovely boy.Naked he lies upon that memoried bed;By thine own hand he lies uncoverèd.There was he wont thy dangling sense to cloy,Ande uncloy with more cloying, and annoyWith newer uncloying till thy senses bled.\\xa0His hand and mouth knew games to reinstalDesire that thy worn spine was hurt to follow.Sometimes it seemed to thee that all was hollowIn sense in each new straining of sucked lust.Then still new turns of toying would he callTo thy nerves’ flesh, and thou wouldst tremble and fallBack on thy cushions with thy mind's sense hushed.\\xa0«Beautiful was my love, yet melancholy. He had that art, that makes love captive wholly, Of being slowly sad among lust's rages. Now the Nile gave him up, the eternal Nile. Under his wet locks Death's blue paleness wages Now war upon our wishing with sad smile.»\\xa0Even as he thinks, the lust that is no moreThan a memory of lust revives and takesHis senses by the hand, his felt flesh wakes,And all becomes again what 'twas before.The dead body on the bed starts up and livesAnd comes to lie with him, close, closer, andA creeping love-wise and invisible handAt every body-entrance to his lustWhispers caresses which flit off yet justRemain enough to bleed his last nerve's strand,O sweet and cruel Parthian fugitives!\\xa0So he half rises, looking on his lover,That now can love nothing but what none know.Vaguely half-seeing what he doth behold,He runs his cold lips all the body over.And so ice-senseless are his lips that, lo!,He scarce tastes death from the dead body's cold,But it seems both are dead or living bothAnd love is still the presence and the mover.Then his lips cease on the other lips' cold sloth.\\xa0Ah, there the wanting breath reminds his lipsThat from beyond the gods hath moved a mistBetween him and this boy. His finger-tips,Still idly searching o'er the body, listFor some flesh-response to their waking mood.But their love-question is not understood:The god is dead whose cult was to be kissed!\\xa0He lifts his hand up to where heaven should beAnd cries on the mute gods to know his pain.Let your calm faces turn aside to his plea,O granting powers! He will yield up his reign.\\xa0In the still deserts he will parchèd live,In the far barbarous roads beggar or slave,But to his arins again the warm boy give!Forego that space ye meant to be his grave!\\xa0Take all the female loveliness of earth And in one mound of death its remnant spill! But, by sweet Ganymede, that Jove found worth And above Hebe did elect to fillHis cup at his high feasting, and instil The friendlier love that fills the other's dearth, The clod of female embraces resolve To dust, O father of the gods, but spare This boy and his white body and golden hair! Maybe thy better Ganymede thou feel'st That he should be, and out of jealous care From Hadrian's arms to thine his beauty steal'st.\\xa0He was a kitten playing with lust, playingWith his own and with Hadrian's, sometimes oneAnd sometimes two, now linking, now undone;Now Ieaving lust, now lust's high lusts delaying;Now eyeing lust not wide, but from askanceJumping round on lust's half-unexpectance;Now softly gripping, then with fury holding,Now playfully playing, now seriously, now lyingBy th' side of lust looking at it, now spyingWhich way to take lust in his lust's withholding.\\xa0Thus did the hours slide from their tangled handsAnd from their mixèd limbs the moments slip.Now were his arms dead leaves, now iron bands;Now were his lips cups, now the things that sip;Now were his eyes too closed and now too looking;Now were his uncontinuings frenzy working;Now were his arts a feather and now a whip.\\xa0That love they lived as a religionOffered to gods that come themselves to men.Sometimes he was adorned or made to donHalf-vestures, then in statued nudityDid imitate some god that seems to beBy marble's accurate virtue men's again.Now was he Venus, white out of the seas;And now was he Apollo, young and golden;Now as Jove sate he in mock judgment overThe presence at his feet of his slaved lover;Now was he an acted rite, by one beholden,In ever-repositioned mysteries.\\xa0Now he is something anyone can be.O stark negation of the thing it is!O golden-haired moon-cold loveliness!Too cold! too cold! and love as cold as he!Love through the memories of his love doth roamAs through a labyrinth, in sad madness glad,And now calls on his name and bids him come,And now is smiling at his imaged comingThat is i'th' heart like faces in the gloaming —Mere shining shadows of the forms they had.\\xa0The rain again like a vague pain aroseAnd put the sense of wetness in the air.Suddenly did the Emperor supposeHe saw this room and all in it from far.He saw the couch, the boy, and his own frameCast down against the couch, and he becameA clearer presence to himself, and saidThese words unuttered, save to his soul's dread:\\xa0« I shall build thee a statue that will be To the continued future evidence\\xa0Of my love and thy beauty and the senseThat beauty giveth ot divinity.Though death with subtle uncovering hands removeThe apparel of life and empire from our love,Yet its nude statue, that thou dost inspirit,All future times, whether they will't or not,Shall, like a gift a forcing god hath brought,Inevitably inherit.\\xa0«Ay, this thy statue shall I build, and setUpon the pinnacle of being thine, that TimeBy its subtle dim crimeWill fear to eat it from life, or to fretWith war's or envy's rage from bulk and stone.Fate cannot be that! Gods themselves, that makeThings change, Fate's own hand, that doth overtakeThe gods themselves with darkness, will draw backFrom marring thus thy statue and my boon,Leaving the wide world hollow with thy lack.\\xa0«This picture of our love will bridge the ages.It will loom white out of the past and beEternal, like a Roman victory,In every heart ,the future will give ragesOf not being our love's contemporary.\\xa0«Yet oh that this were needed not, and thou Wert the red flower perfuming my life, The garland on the brows of my delight, The living flame on altars of my soul! Would all this were a thing thou mightest now Smile at from under thy death-mocking lids And wonder that I should so put a strife Twixt me and gods for thy lost presence bright; Were there nought in this but my empty dole\\xa0And thy awakening smile half to condole With what my dreaming pain to hope forbids.»\\xa0Thus went he, like a lover who is waiting,From place to place in his dim doubting mind.Now was his hope a great intention fatingIts wish to being, now felt he he was blindIn some point of his seen wish undefined.\\xa0When love meets death we know not what to feel.When death foils love we know not what to know.Now did his doubt hope, now did his hope doubt;Now what his wish dreamed the dream's sense did floutAnd to a sullen emptiness congeal.Thcn again the gods fanned love's darkening glow.\\xa0«Thy death has given me a higher lust —A flesh-lust raging for eternity.On mine imperial fate I set my trustThat the high gods,that made me emperor be,Will not annul from a more real lifeMy wish that thou should'st live for e'er and standA fleshly presence on their better land,More lovely yet not lovelier, for thereNo things impossible our wishes marNor pain our hearts with change and time and strife.\\xa0«Love, love, my love! thou art already a god.This thought of mine, which I a wish believe,Is no wish, but a sight, to me allowedBy the great gods, that love love and can giveTo mortal hearts, under the shape of wishes —Of wishes having undiscovered reaches —,A vision of the real things beyondOur life-imprisoned life, our sense-bound sense.Ay, what I wish thee to be thou art now\\xa0Already. Already on Olympic groundThou walkest and art perfect, yet art thou,For thou needst no excess of thee to donPerfect to be, being perfection.\\xa0«My heart is singing like a morning bird.A great hope from the gods comes down to meAnd bids my heart to subtler sense be stirredAnd think not that strange evil of theeThat to think thee mortal would be.\\xa0«My love, my love, my god-love! Let me kissOn thy cold lips thy hot lips now immortal,Greeting thee at Death's portal's happiness,For to the gods Death's portal is Life's portal.\\xa0«Were no Olympus yet for thee, my loveWould make thee one, where thou sole god mightst prove, And I thy sole adorer, glad to beThy sole adorer through infinity. That were a universe divine enough For love and me and what to me thou art. To have thee is a thing made of gods' stuff And to look on thee eternity's best part.\\xa0«But this is true and mine own art: the god Thou art now is a body made by me, For, if thou art now flesh reality Beyond where men age and night cometh still, 'Tis to my love's great making power thou owest 'I'hat life thou on thy merúory bestowest And mak'st it carnal. Had my love not held An empire of my mighty legioned will, Thou to gods' consort hadst not been compelled.\\xa0«My love that found thee, when it found thee didBut find its own true body and exact look.Therefore when now thy memory I bidBecome a god where gods are, I but moveTo death's high column's top the shape it tookAnd set it there for vision of all love.\\xa0«O love, my love, put up with my strong willOf loving to Olympus, be thou thereThe latest god, whose honey-coloured hairTakes divine eyes! As thou wert on earthe, stillIn heaven bodifully be and roam,A prisoner of that happiness of home,With elder gods, while I on earth do makeA statue for thy deathlessness' seen sake.\\xa0\\xa0«Yet thy true deathless statue I shall buildWill be no stone thing, but that same regretBy which our love's eternity is willed.One side of that is thou, as gods see theeNow, and the other, here, thy memory.My sorrow wiII make that men's god, and setThy naked memory on the parapetThat looks upon the seas of future times.Some will say all our love was but our crimes;Others against our names the knives will whetOf their glad hate of beauty's beauty, and makeOur names a base of heap whereon to rakeThe names of all our brothers with quick scorn.Yet will our presence, like eternal Morn,Ever return at Beauty's hour, and shineOut of the East of Love, in light to enshrineNew gods to come, the lacking world to adorn.\\xa0«All that thou art now is thyself and I.Our dual presence has its unityIn that perfection of body which my loveBy loving it, became, and did from lifeRaise into godness, calm above the strifeOf times, and changing passions far above.\\xa0«But since men see more with the eyes than soul,Still I in stone shall utter this great dole;Still, eager that men hunger by thy presence,I shall to marble carry this regretThat in my heart like a great star is set.Thus, even in stone, our love shall stand so greatIn thy statue of us, like a god's fate,Our love’s incarnate and discarnate essence,That, like a trumpet reaching over seasAnd going from continent to continent,Our love shall speak its joy and woe, death-blent,Over infinities and eternities.\\xa0«And here, memory or statue, we shall stand,Still the same one, as we were hand in handNor felt each other's hand for feeling feeling.Men still will see me when thy sense they take.The entire gods might pass, in the vast wheelingOf the globed ages. If but for thy sake,That, being theirs, hadst gone with their gone band,They would return, as they had slept to wake.\\xa0«Then the end of days when Jove were born againAnd Ganymede again pour at his feastWould see our dual soul from death releasedAnd recreated unto joy, fear, pain —All that love doth contain;Life — all the beauty that doth make a lust\\xa0Of love's own true love, at the spell amazed;And, if our very memory wore to dust,By some god's race of the end of ages mustOur dual unity again be raised.»\\xa0It rained still. But slow-treading night came in,Closing the weary eyelids of each sense.The very consciousness of self and soulGrew, like a landscape through dim raining, dim.The Emperor lay still, so still that nowHe half forgot where now he lay, or whenceThe sorrow that was still salt on his lips.All had been something very far, a scrollRolled up. The things he felt were like the rimThat haloes round the moon when the night weeps.\\xa0His head was bowed into his arms, and theyOn the low couch, foreign to his sense, lay.His closed eyes seemed open to him, and seeingThe naked floor, dark, cold, sad and unmeaning.His hurting breath was all his sense could know.Out of the falling darkness the wind roseAnd fell; a voice swooned in the courts below;And the Emperor slept.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The gods came now And bore something away, no sense knows how, On unseen arms of power and repose.\\n\",\n",

       "  'text': '\\nPREFÁCIO \\n[a Quinto Império, de Augusto Ferreira Gomes]\\n\\nA esperança do Quinto Império, tal qual em Portugal a sonhamos e concebemos, não se ajusta, por natureza, ao que a tradição figura como o sentido da interpretação dada por Daniel ao sonho de Nebucadnezar.\\nNessa figuração tradicional, é este o seguimento dos impérios: o Primeiro é o da Babilónia, o Segundo o Medo-Persa, o Terceiro o da Grécia e o Quarto o de Roma, ficando o Quinto, como sempre, duvidoso. Nesse esquema, porém, que é de impérios materiais, o último é plausivelmente entendido como sendo o Império de Inglaterra. Desse modo se interpreta naquele país; e creio que nesse nível, se interpreta bem.\\nNão é assim no esquema português. Este, sendo espiritual, em vez de partir, como naquela tradição, do Império material de Babilónia, parte, antes, com a civilização em que vivemos, do império espiritual da Grécia, origem do que espiritualmente somos. E, sendo esse o Primeiro Império, o Segundo é o de Roma, o Terceiro o da Cristandade, e o Quarto o da Europa - isto é, da Europa laica de depois da Renascença. Aqui o Quinto Império terá que ser outro que o inglês, porque terá que ser de outra ordem. Nós o atribuímos a Portugal, para quem o esperamos.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0*\\n\\nA chave está dada, clara e obscuramente, na primeira quadra do Terceiro Corpo das Profecias do Bandarra, entendendo-se que Bandarra é um nome colectivo, pelo qual se designa, não só o vidente de Trancoso, mas todos quantos viram, por seu exemplo, à mesma Luz. Este Terceiro Corpo não é, nem poderia ser do Bandarra de Trancoso. Dizemos, contudo, que é do Bandarra.\\nA quadra é assim:\\n\\nEm vós que haveis de ser Quinto \\n\\nDepois de morto o Segundo,\\n\\n\\nMinhas profecias fundo \\n\\n\\nNestas letras que VOS Pinto.\\n\\n\\nA palavra VOS, no quarto verso, tem a variante AQUI em alguns textos. Mas, de qualquer dos modos, a interpretação vem a ser igual.\\nConsiderando, pelo lema da Tripeça, que todas as profecias têm três tempos distintos, esta será interpretada em relação a três tempos de Portugal, segundo as “letras” são “pintadas”. Se as letras são as da palavra VOS, indicam, como se mandou que se soubesse, Vis, Otium, Scientia. E se as letras são as da palavra AQUI, indicam, segundo a mesma ordem, Arma, Quies, Intellectus, que logo se vê serem termos sinónimos dos outros.\\nTemos pois que a Nação Portuguesa percorre, em seu caminho imperial, três tempos - o primeiro caracterizado pela Forca (Vis) ou as Armas (Arma), o segundo pelo Ócio (Otium) ou o Sossego (Quies), e o terceiro pela Ciência (Scientia) ou a Inteligência (Intellectus). E os tempos e os modos estão indicados nos primeiros dois versos da quadra:\\n\\n\\nEm vós que haveis de ser Quinto\\n\\n\\nDepois de morto o Segundo...\\n\\n\\nNo primeiro tempo - a Força ou Armas - trata-se de el-rei D. Manuel o Primeiro, que é o quinto rei da dinastia de Avis, e sucede a D. João o Segundo, depois deste morto. Foi então o auge do nosso período de Força ou Armas, isto é, de poder temporal.\\nNo segundo tempo - Ócio ou Sossego - trata-se de el-rei D. João o Quinto, que sucede a D. Pedro o Segundo, depois de este morto. Foi então o auge do nosso período de esterilidade rica, do nosso repouso do poder - o ócio ou sossego da profecia.\\nNo terceiro tempo - Ciência ou Inteligência - trata-se do Quinto Império, que sucederá ao Segundo, que é o de Roma, depois de este morto.\\nQuanto ao que quer dizer esta Roma, a cujo fim ou morte se seguirá o Império Português, ou Quinto Império, ou o que seja a Ciência ou Inteligência que definirá a este - não direi se o sei ou o não sei, se o presumo ou o não presumo. Saber seria de mais; presumir seria de menos. Quem puder compreender que compreenda.\\n\\nAs profecias são de duas ordens — as que, como a de Daniel e esta do falso Bandarra, têm em si uma grande luz; e as que, como as do vero Bandarra e as do livro presente, têm em si uma grande treva. Aquelas são o fio do labirinto, estas o mesmo labirinto. Umas e outras, porém, entre si se complementam. Por umas as outras se esclarecem, tanto quanto pode ser, porque a luz afasta as trevas, mas sem as trevas se não veria a luz. Tão certo é o que se diz em certo passo secreto — que a melhor luz que temos neste mundo não é mais que treva visível...\\n',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nO conceito de “quinto império” é antigo na profética cristã e pré-cristã, entendendo por “pré-cristã” a hebraica, isto é, a daquele povo que foi especialmente pré-cristão em ser, em grande parte, origem do mesmo cristianismo. No esquema profético, em que este conceito aparece, determina-se a existência de cinco impérios até àquilo a que simbolicamente os profetas chamam “o fim do mundo” — expressão esta que eles porventura sentem como sendo efectivamente o “fim do mundo”, mas que deve entender-se como significando o fim do que para eles é o “mundo”, isto é, o fim do conceito que têm do mundo, ou, esclarecendo melhor, o fim do ciclo psíquico — ordinariamente um ciclo religioso — a que pertencem e em que pensam. Convém notar bem este sentido profético da expressão, tantas vezes empregada, o “fim do mundo”, ou “o fim da coisas”. Usada por um cristão, serve ela instintivamente de designar o fim da religião cristã; como, porém, uma mentalidade religiosa não concebe, de instinto ou de inteligência, o fim da sua religião — que seria o fim da Verdade, o que é impensável —, o que aparece na sua visão profética como o fim dessa religião, imediatamente se lhe desenha no espírito como o fim do mesmo mundo, a dissolução das coisas, a morte do universo — a tal ponto, e tão naturalmente, confundimos o universo real com o nosso conceito dele. Quando, por isso, o católico Nostradamo profetiza para o fim do século vinte o “fim das coisas” entendemo-lo como prevendo para esse tempo, não o acabamento da terra, ou a extinção da matéria universal, mas tão-somente o fim ou da religião cristã, ou, pelo menos, da sua forma católica, se não for apenas o da forma romana do catolicismo.

Todas as profecias têm três realizações, e isto é simbolizado pela tripeça, que tem três pés. Não é por isso tão fácil como se julga dar a interpretação de uma profecia, pois que uma só interpretação (sempre fácil de conseguir, dado certo engenho) nada vale se não for acompanhada de mais duas, que com ela devem ter certa relação.\\nEssa relação pode ser de três ordens: espacial, temporal, intelectual. Se um evento profetizado cai sob a ordem espacial, então dá-se no mesmo lugar ou país em três tempos diferentes, e tem que haver concordância perfeita (a história repete-se) entre os três eventos. Se um evento profetizado cai sob a ordem temporal, então dá-se ao mesmo tempo (ou, pelo menos, no mesmo ano) em três países. Se o evento cai sob a ordem intelectual, então dá-se de três maneiras iguais (idênticas) no material, no intelectual e no espiritual.\\nImpério é domínio, e pode ser domínio material, domínio intelectual e domínio espiritual. A fórmula profética do Quinto Império é pois aplicável a estes três planos, e em cada plano se revelará da mesma maneira.\\nNo plano material, que é o que se tem suposto até agora ser o único, os quatro Impérios que precedem o Quinto são os de ..., de ..., de Grécia, de Roma; o Quinto será o europeu, de sorte que nesta interpretação a profecia está consumada. Estamos já, segundo ela, no Quinto Império.\\nNo plano intelectual, como o reino da Inteligência começa só com a Grécia, onde nasceu o espírito crítico, que é o em que a inteligência se define, os quatro impérios são o grego, o romano, o cristão ou medieval, o europeu, e ainda falta o quinto, que deverá ser o Universal .\\nNa ordem espiritual, como o domínio do espírito verdadeiramente começou com os egípcios, os três primeiros impérios são o de Osíris, o de Baco, e o de Cristo, em que estamos, devendo notar-se que, entendidos em certo modo, estes três Deuses são três formas do mesmo Deus. Faltam-nos ainda dois magnos impérios ate à consumação dos tempos e cessação de ser necessário o mundo.\\nO sentido em que tomaremos particularmente as profecias aqui expressas é o segundo, pois o primeiro está extinto, o terceiro muito longe na sua consumação.\\n',\n",
